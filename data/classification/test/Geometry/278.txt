In the Euclidean three-dimensional space, we call folding of a sphere S every partition of S setminus {x,y } into disjoint circles, where x and y are two points of S. A folding of S is called linear if the circles of the folding are obtained by the intersection of S with a family of parallel planes or with a family of planes containing a straight line D exterior to S. Is every folding of a sphere S linear?
