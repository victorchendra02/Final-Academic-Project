Let S be a point inside angle pOq, and let k be a circle which contains S and touches the legs Op and Oq in points P and Q respectively. Straight line s parallel to Op from S intersects Oq in a point R. Let T be the intersection point of the ray PS and circumscribed circle of vartriangle SQR and T ne S. Prove that OT // SQ and OT is a tangent of the circumscribed circle of vartriangle SQR.
