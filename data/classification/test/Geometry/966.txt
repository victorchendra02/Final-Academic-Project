Let O be the circumcenter of an acute-angled triangle ABC with { angle B< angle C}. The line AO meets the side BC at D. The circumcenters of the triangles ABD and ACD are E and F, respectively. Extend the sides BA and CA beyond A, and choose on the respective extensions points G and H such that {AG=AC} and {AH=AB}. Prove that the quadrilateral EFGH is a rectangle if and only if { angle ACB- angle ABC=60^{ circ }}. Proposed by Hojoo Lee, Korea
