A circle having common centre with the circumcircle of triangle ABC meets the sides of the triangle at six points forming convex hexagon A_{1}A_{2}B_{1}B_{2}C_{1}C_{2} (A_{1} and A_{2} lie on BC, B_{1} and B_{2} lie on AC, C_{1} and C_{2} lie on AB). If A_{1}B_{1} is parallel to the bisector of angle B, prove that A_{2}C_{2} is parallel to the bisector of angle C. Proposed by S. Berlov
