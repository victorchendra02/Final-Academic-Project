Let AA'BCC'B' be a convex cyclic hexagon such that AC is tangent to the incircle of the triangle A'B'C', and A'C' is tangent to the incircle of the triangle ABC. Let the lines AB and A'B' meet at X and let the lines BC and B'C' meet at Y. Prove that if XBYB' is a convex quadrilateral, then it has an incircle.
