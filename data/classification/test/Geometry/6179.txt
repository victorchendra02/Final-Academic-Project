Five points A, B, C, D and E lie on a circle tau clockwise in that order such that AB parallel CE and angle ABC > 90^{ circ}. Let k be a circle tangent to AD, CE and tau such that k and tau touch on the arc widehat{DE} not containing A, B and C. Let F neq A be the intersection of tau and the tangent line to k passing through A different from AD. Prove that there exists a circle tangent to BD, BF, CE and tau.
