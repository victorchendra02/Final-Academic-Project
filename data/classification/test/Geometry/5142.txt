Let ABC be a triangle with incentre I and circumcircle omega. Let N denote the second point of intersection of line AI and omega. The line through I perpendicular to AI intersects line BC, segment [AB], and segment [AC] at the points D, E, and F, respectively. The circumcircle of triangle AEF meets omega again at P, and lines PN and BC intersect at Q. Prove that lines IQ and DN intersect on omega.
