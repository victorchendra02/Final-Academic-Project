Two concentric circles have radii R and r respectively. Determine the greatest possible number of circles that are tangent to both these circles and mutually nonintersecting. Prove that this number lies between frac 32 cdot frac{ sqrt R + sqrt r }{ sqrt R - sqrt r } -1 and frac{63}{20} cdot frac{R+r}{R-r}.
