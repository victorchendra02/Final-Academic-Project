Let ABCD be a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle omega with center O. Let P be the intersection of two diagonals AC and BD. Let Q be a point lying on the segment OP. Let E and F be the orthogonal projections of Q on the lines AD and BC, respectively. The points M and N lie on the circumcircle of triangle QEF such that QM parallel AC and QN parallel BD. Prove that the two lines ME and NF meet on the perpendicular bisector of segment CD. Proposed by Tran Quang Hung, Vietnam
