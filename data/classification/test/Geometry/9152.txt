Let S be the circle of center O and radius R, and let A, A' be two diametrically opposite points in S. Let P be the midpoint of OA' and ell a line passing through P, different from AA ' and from the perpendicular on AA '. Let B and C be the intersection points of ell with S and let M be the midpoint of BC. a) Let H be the foot of the altitude from A in the triangle ABC. Let D be the intersection point of the line A'M with AH. Determine the locus of point D while ell varies . b) Line AM intersects OD at I. Prove that 2 OI = ID and determine the locus of point I while ell varies .
