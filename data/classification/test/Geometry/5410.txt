item Two circles Gamma_1 and Gamma_2 intersect at points A and B. Consider a circle Gamma contained in Gamma_1 and Gamma_2, which is tangent to both of them at D and E respectively. Let C be one of the intersection points of line AB with Gamma, F be the intersection of line EC with Gamma_2 and G be the intersection of line DC with Gamma_1. Let H and I be the intersection points of line ED with Gamma_1 and Gamma_2 respectively. Prove that F, G, H and I are on the same circle.
