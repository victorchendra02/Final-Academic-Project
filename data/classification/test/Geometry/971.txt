Given a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, let M be the midpoint of the side CD, and let N be a point on the circumcircle of triangle ABM. Assume that the point N is different from the point M and satisfies frac{AN}{BN}= frac{AM}{BM}. Prove that the points E, F, N are collinear, where E=AC cap BD and F=BC cap DA.
