Consider a regular 2n-gon and the n diagonals of it that pass through its center. Let P be a point of the inscribed circle and let a_1, a_2, ldots , a_n be the angles in which the diagonals mentioned are visible from the point P. Prove that sum_{i=1}^n tan^2 a_i = 2n frac{ cos^2 frac{ pi}{2n}}{ sin^4 frac{ pi}{2n}}.
