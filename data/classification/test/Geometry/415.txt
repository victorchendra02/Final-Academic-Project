In a given right triangle ABC, the hypotenuse BC, of length a, is divided into n equal parts (n and odd integer). Let alpha be the acute angel subtending, from A, that segment which contains the mdipoint of the hypotenuse. Let h be the length of the altitude to the hypotenuse fo the triangle. Prove that: tan{ alpha}= dfrac{4nh}{(n^2-1)a}.
