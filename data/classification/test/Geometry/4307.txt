Quadrilateral ABCD is given with AD nparallel BC. The midpoints of AD and BC are denoted by M and N, respectively. The line MN intersects the diagonals AC and BD in points K and L, respectively. Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles AKM and BNL have common point on the line AB.( Proposed by Emil Stoyanov ) http://estoyanov.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/est.png
