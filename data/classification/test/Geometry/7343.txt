Let triangle ABC be a right-angled triangle with angle BAC = 90^{ circ} and let E be the foot of the perpendicular from A to BC. Let Z ne A be a point on the line AB with AB = BZ. Let (c) be the circumcircle of the triangle triangle AEZ. Let D be the second point of intersection of (c) with ZC and let F be the antidiametric point of D with respect to (c). Let P be the point of intersection of the lines FE and CZ. If the tangent to (c) at Z meets PA at T, prove that the points T, E, B, Z are concyclic. Proposed by Theoklitos Parayiou, Cyprus
