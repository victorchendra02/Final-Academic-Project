In tetrahedron ABCD, vertex D is connected with D_0, the centrod if triangle ABC. Line parallel to DD_0 are drawn through A,B and C. These lines intersect the planes BCD, CAD and ABD in points A_2, B_1, and C_1, respectively. Prove that the volume of ABCD is one third the volume of A_1B_1C_1D_0. Is the result if point D_o is selected anywhere within triangle ABC?
