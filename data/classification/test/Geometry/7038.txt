Let ABC be a triangle, and let P be a distinct point on the plane. Moreover, let A'B'C' be a homothety of ABC with ratio 2 and center P, and let O and O' be the circumcenters of ABC and A'B'C', respectively. The circumcircles of AB'C', A'BC', and A'B'C meet at points X, Y, and Z, different from A', B', and C'. In a similar way, the circumcircles of A'BC, AB'C, and ABC' meet at X', Y', and Z', different from A, B, C. Let W and W' be the circumcenters of XYZ and X'Y'Z', respectively. Prove that OW is parallel to O'W'. Proposed by Mateus Thimoteo, Brazil.
