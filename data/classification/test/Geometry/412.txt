Consider a plane epsilon and three non-collinear points A,B,C on the same side of epsilon; suppose the plane determined by these three points is not parallel to epsilon. In plane epsilon take three arbitrary points A',B',C'. Let L,M,N be the midpoints of segments AA', BB', CC'; Let G be the centroid of the triangle LMN. (We will not consider positions of the points A', B', C' such that the points L,M,N do not form a triangle.) What is the locus of point G as A', B', C' range independently over the plane epsilon?
