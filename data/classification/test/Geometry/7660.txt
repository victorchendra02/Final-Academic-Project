Let ABC be a triangle with m ( angle C) = 90^ circ and the points D in [AC], E in [BC]. Inside the triangle we construct the semicircles C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4 of diameters [AC], [BC], [CD], [CE] and let {C, K } = C_1 cap C_2, {C, M } =C_3 cap C_4, {C, L } = C_2 cap C_3, {C, N } =C_1 cap C_4. Show that points K, L, M, N are concyclic.
