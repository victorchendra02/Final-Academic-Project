Two circles Gamma_1 and Gamma_2 meet at two distinct points A and B. A line passing through A meets Gamma_1 and Gamma_2 again at C and D respectively, such that A lies between C and D. The tangent at A to Gamma_2 meets Gamma_1 again at E. Let F be a point on Gamma_2 such that F and A lie on different sides of BD, and 2 angle AFC= angle ABC. Prove that the tangent at F to Gamma_2, and lines BD and CE are concurrent.
