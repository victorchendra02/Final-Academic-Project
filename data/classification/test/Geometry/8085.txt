In a forest there are 5 trees A, B, C, D, E that are in that order on a straight line. At the midpoint of AB there is a daisy, at the midpoint of BC there is a rose bush, at the midpoint of CD there is a jasmine, and at the midpoint of DE there is a carnation. The distance between A and E is 28 m; the distance between the daisy and the carnation is 20 m. Calculate the distance between the rose bush and the jasmine.
