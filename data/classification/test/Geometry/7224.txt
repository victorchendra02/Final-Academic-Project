Triangle ABC is given. An arbitrary circle with center J, passing through B and C, intersects the sides AC and AB at E and F, respectively. Let X be a point such that triangle FXB is similar to triangle EJC (with the same order) and the points X and C lie on the same side of the line AB. Similarly, let Y be a point such that triangle EYC is similar to triangle FJB (with the same order) and the points Y and B lie on the same side of the line AC. Prove that the line XY passes through the orthocenter of the triangle ABC. Proposed by Nguyen Van Linh - Vietnam
