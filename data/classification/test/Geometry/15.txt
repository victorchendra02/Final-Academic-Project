Let D be an interior point of the acute triangle ABC with AB > AC so that angle DAB = angle CAD. The point E on the segment AC satisfies angle ADE = angle BCD, the point F on the segment AB satisfies angle FDA = angle DBC, and the point X on the line AC satisfies CX = BX. Let O_1 and O_2 be the circumcenters of the triangles ADC and EXD, respectively. Prove that the lines BC, EF, and O_1O_2 are concurrent.
