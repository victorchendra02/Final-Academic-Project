Suppose ,G , is a connected graph with ,k , edges. Prove that it is possible to label the edges 1,2, ldots ,k , in such a way that at each vertex which belongs to two or more edges, the greatest common divisor of the integers labeling those edges is equal to 1. Note: Graph-Definition. A graph consists of a set of points, called vertices, together with a set of edges joining certain pairs of distinct vertices. Each pair of vertices ,u,v , belongs to at most one edge. The graph G is connected if for each pair of distinct vertices ,x,y , there is some sequence of vertices ,x = v_{0},v_{1},v_{2}, cdots ,v_{m} = y , such that each pair ,v_{i},v_{i + 1} ;(0 leq i < m) , is joined by an edge of ,G.
