Given a sequence s consisting of digits 0 and 1. For any positive integer k, define v_k the maximum number of ways in any sequence of length k that several consecutive digits can be identified, forming the sequence s. (For example, if s=0110, then v_7=v_8=2, because in sequences 0110110 and 01101100 one can find consecutive digits 0110 in two places, and three pairs of 0110 cannot meet in a sequence of length 7 or 8.) It is known that v_n<v_{n+1}<v_{n+2} for some positive integer n. Prove that in the sequence s, all the numbers are the same. A. Golovanov
