Let n geq 1 be an integer. A path from (0,0) to (n,n) in the xy plane is a chain of consecutive unit moves either to the right (move denoted by E) or upwards (move denoted by N), all the moves being made inside the half-plane x geq y. A step in a path is the occurence of two consecutive moves of the form EN. Show that the number of paths from (0,0) to (n,n) that contain exactly s steps (n geq s geq 1) is frac{1}{s} binom{n-1}{s-1} binom{n}{s-1}.
