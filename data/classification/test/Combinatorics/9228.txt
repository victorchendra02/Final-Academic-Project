Fix integers n ge k ge 2. We call a collection of integral valued coins n-diverse if no value occurs in it more than n times. Given such a collection, a number S is n-reachable if that collection contains n coins whose sum of values equals S. Find the least positive integer D such that for any n-diverse collection of D coins there are at least k numbers that are n-reachable. Proposed by Alexandar Ivanov, Bulgaria.
