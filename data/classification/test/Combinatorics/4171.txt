Let mathcal{A}_n be the set of n-tuples x = (x_1, ..., x_n) with x_i in {0, 1, 2 }. A triple x, y, z of distinct elements of mathcal{A}_n is called good if there is some i such that {x_i, y_i, z_i } = {0, 1, 2 }. A subset A of mathcal{A}_n is called good if every three distinct elements of A form a good triple. Prove that every good subset of mathcal{A}_n has at most 2( frac{3}{2})^n elements.
