a) Show that the set mathbb{Q}^{ + } of all positive rationals can be partitioned into three disjoint subsets. A,B,C satisfying the following conditions: BA = B; & B^2 = C; & BC = A; where HK stands for the set {hk: h in H, k in K } for any two subsets H, K of mathbb{Q}^{ + } and H^2 stands for HH. b) Show that all positive rational cubes are in A for such a partition of mathbb{Q}^{ + }. c) Find such a partition mathbb{Q}^{ + } = A cup B cup C with the property that for no positive integer n leq 34, both n and n + 1 are in A, that is, text{min} {n in mathbb{N}: n in A, n + 1 in A } > 34.
