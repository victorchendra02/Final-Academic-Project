Let n be an even positive integer. Show that there is a permutation left(x_{1},x_{2}, ldots,x_{n} right) of left(1, ,2, , ldots,n right) such that for every i in left {1, 2, ..., n right }, the number x_{i+1} is one of the numbers 2x_{i}, 2x_{i}-1, 2x_{i}-n, 2x_{i}-n-1. Hereby, we use the cyclic subscript convention, so that x_{n+1} means x_{1}.
