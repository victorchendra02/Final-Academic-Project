A biologist watches a chameleon. The chameleon catches flies and rests after each catch. The biologist notices that: the first fly is caught after a resting period of one minute; the resting period before catching the 2m^ text{th} fly is the same as the resting period before catching the m^ text{th} fly and one minute shorter than the resting period before catching the (2m+1)^ text{th} fly; when the chameleon stops resting, he catches a fly instantly. How many flies were caught by the chameleon before his first resting period of 9 minutes in a row? After how many minutes will the chameleon catch his 98^ text{th} fly? How many flies were caught by the chameleon after 1999 minutes have passed?
