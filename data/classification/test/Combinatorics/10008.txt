A n times n table is filled with the numbers as follows: the first column is filled with 1s, the second column with 2s, and so on. Then, the numbers on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) are erased. Prove that the total sums of the numbers on both sides of the main diagonal differ in exactly two times. (3 points)
