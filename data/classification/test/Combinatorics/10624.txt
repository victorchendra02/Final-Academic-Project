In a graph with n vertices every two vertices are connected by a unique path. For each two vertices u and v, let d(u, v) denote the distance between u and v, i.e. the number of edges in the path connecting these two vertices, and deg(u) denote the degree of a vertex u. Let W be the sum of pairwise distances between the vertices, and D the sum of weighted pairwise distances: sum_{ {u, v }}( deg(u)+ deg(v))d(u, v). Prove that D=4W-n(n-1).
