Integers are written in the cells of a table 2010 times 2010. Adding 1 to all the numbers in a row or in a column is called a move. We say that a table is equilibrium if one can obtain after finitely many moves a table in which all the numbers are equal. Find the largest positive integer n, for which there exists an equilibrium table containing the numbers 2^0, 2^1, ldots , 2^n. For this n, find the maximal number that may be contained in such a table.
