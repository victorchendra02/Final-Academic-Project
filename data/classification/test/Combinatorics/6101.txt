Turbo the snail sits on a point on a circle with circumference 1. Given an infinite sequence of positive real numbers c_1, c_2, c_3, dots, Turbo successively crawls distances c_1, c_2, c_3, dots around the circle, each time choosing to crawl either clockwise or counterclockwise. Determine the largest constant C > 0 with the following property: for every sequence of positive real numbers c_1, c_2, c_3, dots with c_i < C for all i, Turbo can (after studying the sequence) ensure that there is some point on the circle that it will never visit or crawl across.
