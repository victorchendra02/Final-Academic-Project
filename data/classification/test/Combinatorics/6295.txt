To connect to the OFM site, Alice must choose a password. The latter must be consisting of n characters among the following 27 characters: A, B, C, . . ., Y , Z, #We say that a password m is redundant if we can color in red and blue a block of consecutive letters of m in such a way that the word formed from the red letters is identical to the word formed from blue letters. For example, the password H #ZBZJBJZ is redundant, because it contains the ZBZJBJ block, where the word ZBJ appears in both blue and red. At otherwise, the ABCACB password is not redundant. Show that, for any integer n ge 1, there exist at least 18^n passwords of length n, that is to say formed of n characters each, which are not redundant.
