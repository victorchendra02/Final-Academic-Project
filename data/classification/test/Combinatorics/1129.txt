Let p >3 be a prime number. For each nonempty subset T of {0,1,2,3, ldots , p-1 }, let E(T) be the set of all (p-1)-tuples (x_1, ldots ,x_{p-1} ), where each x_i in T and x_1+2x_2+ ldots + (p-1)x_{p-1} is divisible by p and let |E(T)| denote the number of elements in E(T). Prove that |E( {0,1,3 })| geq |E( {0,1,2 })| with equality if and only if p = 5.
