Consider decompositions of an 8 times 8 chessboard into p non-overlapping rectangles subject to the following conditions: (i) Each rectangle has as many white squares as black squares. (ii) If a_i is the number of white squares in the i-th rectangle, then a_1<a_2< ldots <a_p. Find the maximum value of p for which such a decomposition is possible. For this value of p, determine all possible sequences a_1,a_2, ldots ,a_p.
