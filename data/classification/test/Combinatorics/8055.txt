You are given an odd number n ge 3. For every pair of integers (i, j) with 1 le i le j le n there is a domino, with i written on one its end and with j written on another (there are frac{n(n+1)}{2} domino overall). Amin took this dominos and started to put them in a row so that numbers on the adjacent sides of the dominos are equal. He has put k dominos in this way, got bored and went away. After this Anton came to see this k dominos, and he realized that he can't put all the remaining dominos in this row by the rules. For which smallest value of k is this possible? Oleksii Masalitin
