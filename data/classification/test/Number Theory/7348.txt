The positive integer k and the set A of distinct integers from 1 to 3k inclusively are such that there are no distinct a, b, c in A satisfying 2b = a + c. The numbers from A in the interval [1, k] will be called small; those in [k + 1, 2k] - medium and those in [2k + 1, 3k] - large. It is always true that there are no positive integers x and d such that if x, x + d, and x + 2d are divided by 3k then the remainders belong to A and those of x and x + d are different and are: a) small? hspace{1.5px} b) medium? hspace{1.5px} c) large? (In this problem we assume that if a multiple of 3k is divided by 3k then the remainder is 3k rather than 0.)
