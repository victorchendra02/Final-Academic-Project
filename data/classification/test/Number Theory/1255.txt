Define the sequences a_n, b_n, c_n as follows. a_0 = k, b_0 = 4, c_0 = 1. If a_n is even then a_{n + 1} = frac {a_n}{2}, b_{n + 1} = 2b_n, c_{n + 1} = c_n. If a_n is odd, then a_{n + 1} = a_n - frac {b_n}{2} - c_n, b_{n + 1} = b_n, c_{n + 1} = b_n + c_n. Find the number of positive integers k < 1995 such that some a_n = 0.
