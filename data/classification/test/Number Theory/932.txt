We define a sequence left(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3}, ldots right) by a_{n} = frac {1}{n} left( left lfloor frac {n}{1} right rfloor + left lfloor frac {n}{2} right rfloor + cdots + left lfloor frac {n}{n} right rfloor right), where lfloor x rfloor denotes the integer part of x. a) Prove that a_{n+1}>a_n infinitely often. b) Prove that a_{n+1}<a_n infinitely often.
