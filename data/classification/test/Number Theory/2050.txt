Let f(x) = x^8 + 4x^6 + 2x^4 + 28x^2 + 1. Let p > 3 be a prime and suppose there exists an integer z such that p divides f(z). Prove that there exist integers z_1, z_2, ldots, z_8 such that if g(x) = (x - z_1)(x - z_2) cdot ldots cdot (x - z_8), then all coefficients of f(x) - g(x) are divisible by p.
