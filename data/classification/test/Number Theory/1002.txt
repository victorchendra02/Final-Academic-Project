Each positive integer a undergoes the following procedure in order to obtain the number d = d left(a right): (i) move the last digit of a to the first position to obtain the numb er b; (ii) square b to obtain the number c; (iii) move the first digit of c to the end to obtain the number d. (All the numbers in the problem are considered to be represented in base 10.) For example, for a=2003, we get b=3200, c=10240000, and d = 02400001 = 2400001 = d(2003).) Find all numbers a for which d left( a right) =a^2. Proposed by Zoran Sunic, USA
