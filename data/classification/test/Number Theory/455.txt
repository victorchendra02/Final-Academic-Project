For each 1 leq i leq 9 and T in mathbb N, define d_i(T) to be the total number of times the digit i appears when all the multiples of 1829 between 1 and T inclusive are written out in base 10. Show that there are infinitely many T in mathbb N such that there are precisely two distinct values among d_1(T), d_2(T), dots, d_9(T).
