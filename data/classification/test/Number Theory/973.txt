The function f from the set mathbb{N} of positive integers into itself is defined by the equality f(n)= sum_{k=1}^{n} gcd(k,n), qquad n in mathbb{N}. a) Prove that f(mn)=f(m)f(n) for every two relatively prime {m,n in mathbb{N}}. b) Prove that for each a in mathbb{N} the equation f(x)=ax has a solution. c) Find all {a in mathbb{N}} such that the equation f(x)=ax has a unique solution.
