A set A is endowed with a binary operation * satisfying the following four conditions: (1) If a, b, c are elements of A, then a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c , (2) If a, b, c are elements of A such that a * c = b *c, then a = b , (3) There exists an element e of A such that a * e = a for all a in A, and (4) If a and b are distinct elements of A- {e }, then a^3 * b = b^3 * a^2, where x^k = x * x^{k-1} for all integers k ge 2 and all x in A. Determine the largest cardinality A may have. proposed by Bojan Basic, Serbia
