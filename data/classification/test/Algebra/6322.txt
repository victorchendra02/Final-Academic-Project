Consider sequences a_0,a_1,a_2, cdots of non-negative integers defined by selecting any a_0,a_1,a_2 (not all 0) and for each n geq 3 letting a_n = |a_n-1 - a_n-3| 1-In the particular case that a_0 = 1,a_1 = 3 and a_2 = 2, calculate the beginning of the sequence, listing a_0,a_1, cdots,a_{19},a_{20}. 2-Prove that for each sequence, there is a constant c such that a_i leq c for all i geq 0. Note that the constant c my depend on the numbers a_0,a_1 and a_2 3-Prove that, for each choice of a_0,a_1 and a_2, the resulting sequence is eventually periodic. 4-Prove that, the minimum length p of the period described in (3) is the same for all permitted starting values a_0,a_1,a_2 of the sequence
