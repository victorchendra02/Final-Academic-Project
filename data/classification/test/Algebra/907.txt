A sequence of real numbers a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, dots is defined by the formula a_{i + 1} = left lfloor a_{i} right rfloor cdot left langle a_{i} right rangle qquad text{for} quad i geq 0; here a_0 is an arbitrary real number, lfloor a_i rfloor denotes the greatest integer not exceeding a_i, and left langle a_i right rangle=a_i- lfloor a_i rfloor. Prove that a_i=a_{i+2} for i sufficiently large. Proposed by Harmel Nestra, Estionia
