Let a_1,a_2, ldots,a_{2n} be positive real numbers such that a_ja_{n+j}=1 for the values j=1,2, ldots,n. a. Prove that either the average of the numbers a_1,a_2, ldots,a_n is at least 1 or the average of the numbers a_{n+1},a_{n+2}, ldots,a_{2n} is at least 1. b. Assuming that n ge2, prove that there exist two distinct numbers j,k in the set {1,2, ldots,2n } such that |a_j-a_k|< frac{1}{n-1}.
