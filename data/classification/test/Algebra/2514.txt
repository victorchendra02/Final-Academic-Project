Let real numbers x_1, x_2, cdots , x_n satisfy 0 < x_1 < x_2 < cdots< x_n < 1 and set x_0 = 0, x_{n+1} = 1. Suppose that these numbers satisfy the following system of equations: sum_{j=0, j neq i}^{n+1} frac{1}{x_i-x_j}=0 quad text{where } i = 1, 2, . . ., n. Prove that x_{n+1-i} = 1- x_i for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
