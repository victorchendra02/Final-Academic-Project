Consider fractions frac{a}{b} where a and b are positive integers. (a) Prove that for every positive integer n, there exists such a fraction frac{a}{b} such that sqrt{n} le frac{a}{b} le sqrt{n+1} and b le sqrt{n}+1. (b) Show that there are infinitely many positive integers n such that no such fraction frac{a}{b} satisfies sqrt{n} le frac{a}{b} le sqrt{n+1} and b le sqrt{n}.
