Let n be an even positive integer. Prove that there exists a positive inter k such that k = f(x) cdot (x+1)^n + g(x) cdot (x^n + 1) for some polynomials f(x), g(x) having integer coefficients. If k_0 denotes the least such k, determine k_0 as a function of n, i.e. show that k_0 = 2^q where q is the odd integer determined by n = q cdot 2^r, r in mathbb{N}. Note: This is variant A6' of the three variants given for this problem.
