Let f be a function from the set of real numbers mathbb{R} into itself such for all x in mathbb{R}, we have |f(x)| leq 1 and f left( x + frac{13}{42} right) + f(x) = f left( x + frac{1}{6} right) + f left( x + frac{1}{7} right). Prove that f is a periodic function (that is, there exists a non-zero real number c such f(x+c) = f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}).
