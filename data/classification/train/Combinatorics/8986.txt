Celeste has an unlimited amount of each type of n types of candy, numerated type 1, type 2, ... type n. Initially she takes m>0 candy pieces and places them in a row on a table. Then, she chooses one of the following operations (if available) and executes it: 1. She eats a candy of type k, and in its position in the row she places one candy type k-1 followed by one candy type k+1 (we consider type n+1 to be type 1, and type 0 to be type n). 2. She chooses two consecutive candies which are the same type, and eats them. Find all positive integers n for which Celeste can leave the table empty for any value of m and any configuration of candies on the table. textit{Proposed by Federico Bach and Santiago Rodriguez, Colombia}
