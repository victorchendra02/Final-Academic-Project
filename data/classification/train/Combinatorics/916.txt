A cake has the form of an n x n square composed of n^{2} unit squares. Strawberries lie on some of the unit squares so that each row or column contains exactly one strawberry; call this arrangement mathcal{A}. Let mathcal{B} be another such arrangement. Suppose that every grid rectangle with one vertex at the top left corner of the cake contains no fewer strawberries of arrangement mathcal{B} than of arrangement mathcal{A}. Prove that arrangement mathcal{B} can be obtained from mathcal{A} by performing a number of switches, defined as follows: A switch consists in selecting a grid rectangle with only two strawberries, situated at its top right corner and bottom left corner, and moving these two strawberries to the other two corners of that rectangle.
