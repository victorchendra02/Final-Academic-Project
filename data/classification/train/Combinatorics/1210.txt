Determine whether or nor there exist two disjoint infinite sets A and B of points in the plane satisfying the following conditions: a.) No three points in A cup B are collinear, and the distance between any two points in A cup B is at least 1. b.) There is a point of A in any triangle whose vertices are in B, and there is a point of B in any triangle whose vertices are in A.
