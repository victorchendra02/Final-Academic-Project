Let M be the set of all lattice points in the plane (i.e. points with integer coordinates, in a fixed Cartesian coordinate system). For any point P=(x,y) in M we call the points (x-1,y), (x+1,y), (x,y-1), (x,y+1) neighbors of P. Let S be a finite subset of M. A one-to-one mapping f of S onto S is called perfect if f(P) is a neighbor of P, for any P in S. Prove that if such a mapping exists, then there exists also a perfect mapping g:S to S with the additional property g(g(P))=P for P in S.
