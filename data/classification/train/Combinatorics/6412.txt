Let n be a positive integer. We consider the set P of all partitions of n into a sum of positive integers (the order is irrelevant). For every partition alpha, let a_{k}( alpha) be the number of summands in alpha that are equal to k, k = 1,2,...,n. Prove that sum_{ alpha in P} frac{1}{1^{a_{1}( alpha)}a_{1}( alpha)! cdot 2^{a_{2}( alpha)}a_{2}( alpha)!...n^{a_{n}( alpha)}a_{n}( alpha)!}=1.
