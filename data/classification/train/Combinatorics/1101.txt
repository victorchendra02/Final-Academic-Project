In the plane we have n rectangles with parallel sides. The sides of distinct rectangles lie on distinct lines. The boundaries of the rectangles cut the plane into connected regions. A region is nice if it has at least one of the vertices of the n rectangles on the boundary. Prove that the sum of the numbers of the vertices of all nice regions is less than 40n. (There can be nonconvex regions as well as regions with more than one boundary curve.)
