We have n geq 2 lamps L_{1}, . . . ,L_{n} in a row, each of them being either on or off. Every second we simultaneously modify the state of each lamp as follows: if the lamp L_{i} and its neighbours (only one neighbour for i = 1 or i = n, two neighbours for other i) are in the same state, then L_{i} is switched off; otherwise, L_{i} is switched on. Initially all the lamps are off except the leftmost one which is on. (a) Prove that there are infinitely many integers n for which all the lamps will eventually be off. (b) Prove that there are infinitely many integers n for which the lamps will never be all off.
