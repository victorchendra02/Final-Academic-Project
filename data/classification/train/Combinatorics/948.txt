Suppose that a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n are integers such that n mid a_1 + a_2 + ldots + a_n. Prove that there exist two permutations left(b_1,b_2, ldots,b_n right) and left(c_1,c_2, ldots,c_n right) of left(1,2, ldots,n right) such that for each integer i with 1 leq i leq n, we have n mid a_i - b_i - c_i Proposed by Ricky Liu & Zuming Feng, USA
