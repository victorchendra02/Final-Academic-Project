Determine the smallest possible value of | A_{1} cup A_{2} cup A_{3} cup A_{4} cup A_{5} |, where A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}, A_{5} sets simultaneously satisfying the following conditions: (i) | A_{i} cap A_{j} | = 1 for all 1 leq i < j leq 5, i.e. any two distinct sets contain exactly one element in common; (ii) A_{i} cap A_{j} cap A_{k} cap A_{l} = varnothing for all 1 leq i<j<k<l leq 5, i.e. any four different sets contain no common element. Where | S | means the number of elements of S.
