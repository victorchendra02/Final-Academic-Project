Determine the polygons with n sides (n ge 4), not necessarily convex, which satisfy the property that the reflection of every vertex of polygon with respect to every diagonal of the polygon does not fall outside the polygon. Note: Each segment joining two non-neighboring vertices of the polygon is a diagonal. The reflection is considered with respect to the support line of the diagonal.
