Given an initial integer n_0 > 1, two players, { mathcal A} and { mathcal B}, choose integers n_1, n_2, n_3, ldots alternately according to the following rules : I.) Knowing n_{2k}, { mathcal A} chooses any integer n_{2k + 1} such that n_{2k} leq n_{2k + 1} leq n_{2k}^2. II.) Knowing n_{2k + 1}, { mathcal B} chooses any integer n_{2k + 2} such that frac {n_{2k + 1}}{n_{2k + 2}} is a prime raised to a positive integer power. Player { mathcal A} wins the game by choosing the number 1990; player { mathcal B} wins by choosing the number 1. For which n_0 does : a.) { mathcal A} have a winning strategy? b.) { mathcal B} have a winning strategy? c.) Neither player have a winning strategy?
