On an 8 times 8 board, 10 checkers have been placed, each occupying a square. On each square without a token, a number between 0 and 8 is written, which is equal to the number of tokens placed on its neighboring squares. Neighboring cells are those that have a side or a vertex in common. Give a distribution of the tiles that makes the sum of the numbers written on the board the greatest possible.
