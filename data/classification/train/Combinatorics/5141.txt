Determine all integers k geqslant 1 with the following property: given k different colours, if each integer is coloured in one of these k colours, then there must exist integers a_1<a_2< cdots<a_{2023} of the same colour such that the differences a_2-a_1,a_3-a_2, dots,a_{2023}-a_{2022} are all powers of 2.
