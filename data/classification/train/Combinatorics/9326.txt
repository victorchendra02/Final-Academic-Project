Given the natural n. We shall call word sequence from n letters of the alphabet, and distance rho(A, B) between words A=a_1a_2 dots a_n and B=b_1b_2 dots b_n , the number of digits in which they differ (that is, the number of such i, for which a_i ne b_i). We will say that the word C lies between words A and B , if rho (A,B)= rho(A,C)+ rho(C,B). What is the largest number of words you can choose so that among any three, there is a word lying between the other two?
