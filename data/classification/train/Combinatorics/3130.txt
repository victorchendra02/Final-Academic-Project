We consider the division of a chess board 8 times 8 in p disjoint rectangles which satisfy the conditions: a) every rectangle is formed from a number of full squares (not partial) from the 64 and the number of white squares is equal to the number of black squares. b) the numbers a_{1}, ldots, a_{p} of white squares from p rectangles satisfy a_1, , ldots, a_p. Find the greatest value of p for which there exists such a division and then for that value of p, all the sequences a_{1}, ldots, a_{p} for which we can have such a division.
