Here G_{n} denotes a simple undirected graph with n vertices, K_{n} denotes the complete graph with n vertices, K_{n,m} the complete bipartite graph whose components have m and n vertices, and C_{n} a circuit with n vertices. The number of edges in the graph G_{n} is denoted e(G_{n}). The edges of K_{n}(n geq 3) are colored with n colors, and every color is used. Show that there is a triangle whose sides have different colors.
