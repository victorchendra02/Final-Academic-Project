Along a round table are arranged 11 cards with the names ( all distinct ) of the 11 members of the 16^{th} JBMO Problem Selection Committee . The cards are arranged in a regular polygon manner . Assume that in the first meeting of the Committee none of its 11 members sits in front of the card with his name . Is it possible to rotate the table by some angle so that at the end at least two members sit in front of the card with their names ?
