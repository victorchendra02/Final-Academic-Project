Twelve places have been arranged at a round table for members of the Jury, with a name tag at each place . Professor K. being absent-minded instead of occupying his place, sits down at the next place (clockwise) . Each of the other Jury members in turn either occupies the place assigned to this member or, if it has been already occupied, sits down at the first free place in the clockwise order. The resulting seating arrangement depends on the order in which the Jury members come to the table. How many different seating arrangements of this kind are possible? (A Shapovalov)
