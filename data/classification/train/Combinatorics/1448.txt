Let p_n(k) be the number of permutations of the set {1,2,3, ldots,n } which have exactly k fixed points. Prove that sum_{k=0}^nk p_n(k)=n!.(IMO Problem 1) Original formulation Let S be a set of n elements. We denote the number of all permutations of S that have exactly k fixed points by p_n(k). Prove: (a) sum_{k=0}^{n} kp_n(k)=n! ; (b) sum_{k=0}^{n} (k-1)^2 p_n(k) =n! Proposed by Germany, FR
