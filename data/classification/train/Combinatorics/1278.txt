Let n geq 2, n in mathbb{N} and A_0 = (a_{01},a_{02}, ldots, a_{0n}) be any n-tuple of natural numbers, such that 0 leq a_{0i} leq i-1, for i = 1, ldots, n. n-tuples A_1= (a_{11},a_{12}, ldots, a_{1n}), A_2 = (a_{21},a_{22}, ldots, a_{2n}), ldots are defined by: a_{i+1,j} = Card {a_{i,l}| 1 leq l leq j-1, a_{i,l} geq a_{i,j} }, for i in mathbb{N} and j = 1, ldots, n. Prove that there exists k in mathbb{N}, such that A_{k+2} = A_{k}.
