There are n > 2022 cities in the country. Some pairs of cities are connected with straight two-ways airlines. Call the set of the cities { it unlucky}, if it is impossible to color the airlines between them in two colors without monochromatic triangle (i.e. three cities A, B, C with the airlines AB, AC and BC of the same color). The set containing all the cities is unlucky. Is there always an unlucky set containing exactly 2022 cities?
