In the film there is n roles. For each i (1 le i le n), the role of number i can play a_i a person, and one person can play only one role. Every day a casting is held, in which participate people for n roles, and from each role only one person. Let p be a prime number such that p ge a_1, ldots, a_n, n. Prove that you can have p^k castings such that if we take any k people who are tried in different roles, they together participated in some casting (k is a natural number not exceeding n ).
