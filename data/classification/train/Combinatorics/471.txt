Let n and k be two integers with n>k geqslant 1. There are 2n+1 students standing in a circle. Each student S has 2k neighbors - namely, the k students closest to S on the left, and the k students closest to S on the right. Suppose that n+1 of the students are girls, and the other n are boys. Prove that there is a girl with at least k girls among her neighbors. Proposed by Gurgen Asatryan, Armenia
