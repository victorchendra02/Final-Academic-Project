Let n geq 3 be a fixed integer. The number 1 is written n times on a blackboard. Below the blackboard, there are two buckets that are initially empty. A move consists of erasing two of the numbers a and b, replacing them with the numbers 1 and a+b, then adding one stone to the first bucket and gcd(a, b) stones to the second bucket. After some finite number of moves, there are s stones in the first bucket and t stones in the second bucket, where s and t are positive integers. Find all possible values of the ratio frac{t}{s}.
