A rectangular array of numbers is given. In each row and each column, the sum of all numbers is an integer. Prove that each nonintegral number x in the array can be changed into either lceil x rceil or lfloor x rfloor so that the row-sums and column-sums remain unchanged. (Note that lceil x rceil is the least integer greater than or equal to x, while lfloor x rfloor is the greatest integer less than or equal to x.)
