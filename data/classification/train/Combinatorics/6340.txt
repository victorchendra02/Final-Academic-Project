Consider a 3 times7 grid of squares. Each square may be coloured green or white. (a) Is it possible to find a colouring so that no subrectangle has all four corner squares of the same colour? (b) Is it possible for a 4 times 6 grid? Subrectangles must have their corners at grid-points of the original diagram. The corner squares of a subrectangle must be different. The original diagram is a subrectangle of itself.
