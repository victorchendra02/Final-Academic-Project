What is the smallest number of squares of a chess board that can be marked in such a manner that (a) no two marked squares may have a common side or a common vertex, and (b) any unmarked square has a common side or a common vertex with at least one marked square? Indicate a specific configuration of marked squares satisfying (a) and (b) and show that a lesser number of marked squares will not suffice. (A. Andjans, Riga)
