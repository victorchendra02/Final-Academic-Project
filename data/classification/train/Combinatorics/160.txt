An n times n matrix whose entries come from the set S = {1, 2, ldots , 2n - 1 } is called a silver matrix if, for each i = 1, 2, ldots , n, the i-th row and the i-th column together contain all elements of S. Show that: (a) there is no silver matrix for n = 1997; (b) silver matrices exist for infinitely many values of n.
