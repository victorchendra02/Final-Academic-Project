A Knight always tells the truth. A Knave always lies. A Normal may either lie or tell the truth. You are allowed to ask questions that can be answered with ''yes" or ''no", such as ''is this person a Normal?" (a) There are three people in front of you. One is a Knight, another one is a Knave, and the third one is a Normal. They all know the identities of one another. How can you too learn the identity of each?

Prove that the Normals may agree in advance to answer your questions in such a way that you will not be able to learn the identity of any of the four people. (3)
