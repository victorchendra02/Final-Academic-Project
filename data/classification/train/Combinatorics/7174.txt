There is an ant on every vertex of a unit cube. At the time zero, ants start to move across the edges with the velocity of one unit per minute. If an ant reaches a vertex, it alternatively turns right and left (for the first time it will turn in a random direction). If two or more ants meet anywhere on the cube, they die! We know an ant survives after three minutes. Prove that there exists an ant that never dies!
