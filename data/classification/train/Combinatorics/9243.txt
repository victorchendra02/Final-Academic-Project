Fix an integer n ge 2 and let A be an n times n array with n cells cut out so that exactly one cell is removed out of every row and every column. A stick is a 1 times k or k times 1 subarray of A, where k is a suitable positive integer. (a) Determine the minimal number of sticks A can be dissected into. (b) Show that the number of ways to dissect A into a minimal number of sticks does not exceed 100^n. proposed by Palmer Mebane and Nikolai Beluhov a few commentsa variation of part a, was problem 5 a variation of part b, was posted here this post was made in order to complete the post collection of RMM Shortlist 2017
