Every point with integer coordinates in the plane is the center of a disk with radius 1/1000. (1) Prove that there exists an equilateral triangle whose vertices lie in different discs. (2) Prove that every equilateral triangle with vertices in different discs has side-length greater than 96. Radu Gologan, Romania RemarkThe "> 96" in (b) can be strengthened to "> 124". By the way, part (a) of this problem is the place where I used the well-known "Dedekind" theorem.
