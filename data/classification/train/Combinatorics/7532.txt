We can change a natural number n in three ways: a) If the number n has at least two digits, we erase the last digit and we subtract that digit from the remaining number (for example, from 123 we get 12 - 3 = 9); b) If the last digit is different from 0, we can change the order of the digits in the opposite one (for example, from 123 we get 321); c) We can multiply the number n by a number from the set {1, 2, 3,..., 2010 }. Can we get the number 21062011 from the number 1012011?
