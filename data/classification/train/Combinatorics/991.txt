For an {n times n} matrix A, let X_{i} be the set of entries in row i, and Y_{j} the set of entries in column j, {1 leq i,j leq n}. We say that A is golden if {X_{1}, dots ,X_{n},Y_{1}, dots ,Y_{n}} are distinct sets. Find the least integer n such that there exists a {2004 times 2004} golden matrix with entries in the set { {1,2, dots ,n }}.
