A finite number of coins are placed on an infinite row of squares. A sequence of moves is performed as follows: at each stage a square containing more than one coin is chosen. Two coins are taken from this square; one of them is placed on the square immediately to the left while the other is placed on the square immediately to the right of the chosen square. The sequence terminates if at some point there is at most one coin on each square. Given some initial configuration, show that any legal sequence of moves will terminate after the same number of steps and with the same final configuration.
