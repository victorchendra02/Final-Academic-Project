The nonnegative integer n and (2n + 1) times (2n + 1) chessboard with squares colored alternatively black and white are given. For every natural number m with 1 < m < 2n+1, an m times m square of the given chessboard that has more than half of its area colored in black, is called a B-square. If the given chessboard is a B-square, find in terms of n the total number of B-squares of this chessboard.
