Alice and Bob play the following game: Alice picks a set A = {1, 2, ..., n } for some natural number n ge 2. Then, starting from Bob, they alternatively choose one number from the set A, according to the following conditions: initially Bob chooses any number he wants, afterwards the number chosen at each step should be distinct from all the already chosen numbers and should differ by 1 from an already chosen number. The game ends when all numbers from the set A are chosen. Alice wins if the sum of all the numbers that she has chosen is composite. Otherwise Bob wins. Decide which player has a winning strategy.
