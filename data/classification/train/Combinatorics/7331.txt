We have a set of 343 closed jars, each containing blue, yellow and red marbles with the number of marbles from each color being at least 1 and at most 7. No two jars have exactly the same contents. Initially all jars are with the caps up. To flip a jar will mean to change its position from cap-up to cap-down or vice versa. It is allowed to choose a triple of positive integers (b; y; r) in {1; 2; ...; 7 }^3 and flip all the jars whose number of blue, yellow and red marbles differ by not more than 1 from b, y, r, respectively. After n moves all the jars turned out to be with the caps down. Find the number of all possible values of n, if n le 2021.
