Find the largest positive integer k{} for which there exists a convex polyhedron mathcal{P} with 2022 edges, which satisfies the following properties: The degrees of the vertices of mathcal{P} dont differ by more than one, and It is possible to colour the edges of mathcal{P} with k{} colours such that for every colour c{}, and every pair of vertices (v_1, v_2) of mathcal{P}, there is a monochromatic path between v_1 and v_2 in the colour c{}.
