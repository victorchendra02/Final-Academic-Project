Let n geq 3 be a fixed integer. Each side and each diagonal of a regular n-gon is labelled with a number from the set left {1; ;2; ;...; ;r right } in a way such that the following two conditions are fulfilled: 1. Each number from the set left {1; ;2; ;...; ;r right } occurs at least once as a label. 2. In each triangle formed by three vertices of the n-gon, two of the sides are labelled with the same number, and this number is greater than the label of the third side. (a) Find the maximal r for which such a labelling is possible. (b) Harder version (IMO Shortlist 2005): For this maximal value of r, how many such labellings are there? Easier version (5th German TST 2006) - contains answer to the harder versionEasier version (5th German TST 2006): Show that, for this maximal value of r, there are exactly frac{n! left(n-1 right)!}{2^{n-1}} possible labellings.
