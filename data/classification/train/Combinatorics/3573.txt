Let A(n) denote the number of sequences a_1 ge a_2 ge cdots{} ge a_k of positive integers for which a_1+ cdots{}+a_k = n and each a_i +1 is a power of two (i = 1,2, cdots{},k). Let B(n) denote the number of sequences b_1 ge b_2 ge cdots{} ge b_m of positive integers for which b_1+ cdots{}+b_m =n and each inequality b_j ge 2b_{j+1} holds (j=1,2, cdots{}, m-1). Prove that A(n) = B(n) for every positive integer n. Senior Problems Committee of the Australian Mathematical Olympiad Committee
