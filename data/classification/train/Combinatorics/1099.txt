Let n geq 4 be a fixed positive integer. Given a set S = {P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n } of n points in the plane such that no three are collinear and no four concyclic, let a_t, 1 leq t leq n, be the number of circles P_iP_jP_k that contain P_t in their interior, and let m(S)=a_1+a_2+ cdots + a_n.Prove that there exists a positive integer f(n), depending only on n, such that the points of S are the vertices of a convex polygon if and only if m(S) = f(n).
