A holey triangle is an upward equilateral triangle of side length n with n upward unit triangular holes cut out. A diamond is a 60^ circ-120^ circ unit rhombus. Prove that a holey triangle T can be tiled with diamonds if and only if the following condition holds: Every upward equilateral triangle of side length k in T contains at most k holes, for 1 leq k leq n.
