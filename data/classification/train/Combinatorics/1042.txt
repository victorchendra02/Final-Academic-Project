For n an odd positive integer, the unit squares of an n times n chessboard are coloured alternately black and white, with the four corners coloured black. A it tromino is an L-shape formed by three connected unit squares. For which values of n is it possible to cover all the black squares with non-overlapping trominos? When it is possible, what is the minimum number of trominos needed?
