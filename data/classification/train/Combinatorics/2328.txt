Let u_1, u_2, ldots, u_m be m vectors in the plane, each of length leq 1, with zero sum. Show that one can arrange u_1, u_2, ldots, u_m as a sequence v_1, v_2, ldots, v_m such that each partial sum v_1, v_1 + v_2, v_1 + v_2 + v_3, ldots, v_1, v_2, ldots, v_m has length less than or equal to sqrt {5}.
