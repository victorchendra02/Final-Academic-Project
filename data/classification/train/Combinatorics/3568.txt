A collection of n squares on the plane is called tri-connected if the following criteria are satisfied: (i) All the squares are congruent. (ii) If two squares have a point P in common, then P is a vertex of each of the squares. (iii) Each square touches exactly three other squares. How many positive integers n are there with 2018 leq n leq 3018, such that there exists a collection of n squares that is tri-connected?
