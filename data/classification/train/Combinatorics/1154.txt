Let U= {1,2, ldots ,n }, where n geq 3. A subset S of U is said to be split by an arrangement of the elements of U if an element not in S occurs in the arrangement somewhere between two elements of S. For example, 13542 splits {1,2,3 } but not {3,4,5 }. Prove that for any n-2 subsets of U, each containing at least 2 and at most n-1 elements, there is an arrangement of the elements of U which splits all of them.
