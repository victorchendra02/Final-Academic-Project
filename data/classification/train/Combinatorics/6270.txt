Let k,n be positive integers, k,n>1, k<n and a n times n grid of unit squares is given. Ana and Maya take turns in coloring the grid in the following way: in each turn, a unit square is colored black in such a way that no two black cells have a common side or vertex. Find the smallest positive integer n , such that they can obtain a configuration in which each row and column contains exactly k black cells. Draw one example.
