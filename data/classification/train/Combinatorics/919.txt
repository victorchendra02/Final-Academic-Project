Consider a convex polyhedron without parallel edges and without an edge parallel to any face other than the two faces adjacent to it. Call a pair of points of the polyhedron antipodal if there exist two parallel planes passing through these points and such that the polyhedron is contained between these planes. Let A be the number of antipodal pairs of vertices, and let B be the number of antipodal pairs of midpoint edges. Determine the difference A-B in terms of the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces.
