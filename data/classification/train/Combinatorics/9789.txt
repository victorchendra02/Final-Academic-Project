Each of the cells of an m times n table is coloured either black or white. For each cell, the total number of the cells which are in the same row or in the same column and of the same colour as this cell is strictly less than the total number of the cells which are in the same row or in the same column and of the other colour as this cell. Prove that in each row and in each column the number of white cells is the same as the number of black ones. (A Shapovalov)
