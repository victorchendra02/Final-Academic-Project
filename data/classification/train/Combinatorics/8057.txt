Anna and Ben are playing with a permutation p of length 2020, initially p_i = 2021 - i for 1 le i le 2020. Anna has power A, and Ben has power B. Players are moving in turns, with Anna moving first. In his turn player with power P can choose any P elements of the permutation and rearrange them in the way he/she wants. Ben wants to sort the permutation, and Anna wants to not let this happen. Determine if Ben can make sure that the permutation will be sorted (of form p_i = i for 1 le i le 2020) in finitely many turns, if a) A = 1000, B = 1000 b) A = 1000, B = 1001 c) A = 1000, B = 1002 Anton Trygub
