Let k be a positive integer. Scrooge McDuck owns k gold coins. He also owns infinitely many boxes B_1, B_2, B_3, ldots Initially, bow B_1 contains one coin, and the k-1 other coins are on McDuck's table, outside of every box. Then, Scrooge McDuck allows himself to do the following kind of operations, as many times as he likes: - if two consecutive boxes B_i and B_{i+1} both contain a coin, McDuck can remove the coin contained in box B_{i+1} and put it on his table; - if a box B_i contains a coin, the box B_{i+1} is empty, and McDuck still has at least one coin on his table, he can take such a coin and put it in box B_{i+1}. As a function of k, which are the integers n for which Scrooge McDuck can put a coin in box B_n?
