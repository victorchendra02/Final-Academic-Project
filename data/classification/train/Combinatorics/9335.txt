Let P(n) be the number of ways to split a natural number n to the sum of powers of two, when the order does not matter. For example P(5) = 4, as 5=4+1=2+2+1=2+1+1+1=1+1+1+1+1. Prove that for any natural the identity P(n) + (-1)^{a_1} P(n-1) + (-1)^{a_2} P(n-2) + ldots + (-1)^{a_{n-1}} P(1) + (-1)^{a_n} = 0, is true, where a_k is the number of units in the binary number record k . source
