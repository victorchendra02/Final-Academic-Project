In each square of a garden shaped like a 2022 times 2022 board, there is initially a tree of height 0. A gardener and a lumberjack alternate turns playing the following game, with the gardener taking the first turn: The gardener chooses a square in the garden. Each tree on that square and all the surrounding squares of which there are at most eight) then becomes one unit taller. The lumberjack then chooses four different squares on the board. Each tree of positive height on those squares then becomes one unit shorter. We say that a tree is majestic if its height is at least 10^6. Determine the largest K such that the gardener can ensure there are eventually K majestic trees on the board, no matter how the lumberjack plays.
