Let n geq 5 be an integer. Consider n squares with side lengths 1, 2, dots , n, respectively. The squares are arranged in the plane with their sides parallel to the x and y axes. Suppose that no two squares touch, except possibly at their vertices. Show that it is possible to arrange these squares in a way such that every square touches exactly two other squares.
