Cards numbered 1 to 9 are arranged at random in a row. In a move, one may choose any block of consecutive cards whose numbers are in ascending or descending order, and switch the block around. For example, 9 1 underline{6 5 3} 2 7 4 8 may be changed to 9 1 underline{3 5 6} 2 7 4 8. Prove that in at most 12 moves, one can arrange the 9 cards so that their numbers are in ascending or descending order.
