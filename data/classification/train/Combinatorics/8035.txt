Kilua and Ndoti play the following game in a square ABCD: Kilua chooses one of the sides of the square and draws a point X at this side. Ndoti chooses one of the other three sides and draws a point Y. Kilua chooses another side that hasn't been chosen and draws a point Z. Finally, Ndoti chooses the last side that hasn't been chosen yet and draws a point W. Each one of the players can draw his point at a vertex of ABCD, but they have to choose the side of the square that is going to be used to do that. For example, if Kilua chooses AB, he can draws X at the point B and it doesn't impede Ndoti of choosing BC. A vertex cannot de chosen twice. Kilua wins if the area of the convex quadrilateral formed by X, Y, Z, and W is greater or equal than a half of the area of ABCD. Otherwise, Ndoti wins. Which player has a winning strategy? How can he play?
