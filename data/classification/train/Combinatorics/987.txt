Let {n} and k be positive integers. There are given {n} circles in the plane. Every two of them intersect at two distinct points, and all points of intersection they determine are pairwise distinct (i. e. no three circles have a common point). No three circles have a point in common. Each intersection point must be colored with one of n distinct colors so that each color is used at least once and exactly k distinct colors occur on each circle. Find all values of n geq 2 and k for which such a coloring is possible. Proposed by Horst Sewerin, Germany
