Let n and k be positive integers. Cathy is playing the following game. There are n marbles and k boxes, with the marbles labelled 1 to n. Initially, all marbles are placed inside one box. Each turn, Cathy chooses a box and then moves the marbles with the smallest label, say i, to either any empty box or the box containing marble i+1. Cathy wins if at any point there is a box containing only marble n. Determine all pairs of integers (n,k) such that Cathy can win this game.
