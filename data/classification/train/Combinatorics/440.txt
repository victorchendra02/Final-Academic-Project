Lucy starts by writing s integer-valued 2022-tuples on a blackboard. After doing that, she can take any two (not necessarily distinct) tuples mathbf{v}=(v_1, ldots,v_{2022}) and mathbf{w}=(w_1, ldots,w_{2022}) that she has already written, and apply one of the following operations to obtain a new tuple: begin{align*} mathbf{v}+ mathbf{w}&=(v_1+w_1, ldots,v_{2022}+w_{2022}) mathbf{v} lor mathbf{w}&=( max(v_1,w_1), ldots, max(v_{2022},w_{2022})) end{align*}and then write this tuple on the blackboard. It turns out that, in this way, Lucy can write any integer-valued 2022-tuple on the blackboard after finitely many steps. What is the smallest possible number s of tuples that she initially wrote?
