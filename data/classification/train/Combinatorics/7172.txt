In the lake, there are 23 stones arranged along a circle. There are 22 frogs numbered 1, 2, cdots, 22 (each number appears once). Initially, each frog randomly sits on a stone (several frogs might sit on the same stone). Every minute, all frogs jump at the same time as follows: the frog number i jumps i stones forward in the clockwise direction. (In particular, the frog number 22 jumps 1 stone in the counter-clockwise direction.) Prove that at some point, at least 6 stones will be empty.
