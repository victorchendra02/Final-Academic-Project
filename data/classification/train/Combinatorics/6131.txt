A domino is a 1 times 2 or 2 times 1 tile. Let n ge 3 be an integer. Dominoes are placed on an n times n board in such a way that each domino covers exactly two cells of the board, and dominoes do not overlap. The value of a row or column is the number of dominoes that cover at least one cell of this row or column. The configuration is called balanced if there exists some k ge 1 such that each row and each column has a value of k. Prove that a balanced configuration exists for every n ge 3 , and find the minimum number of dominoes needed in such a configuration.
