A family L of 2006 lines on the plane is given in such a way that it doesn't contain parallel lines and it doesn't contain three lines with a common point.We say that the line l_1 in L is bounding the line l_2 in L,if all intersection points of the line l_2 with other lines from L lie on the one side of the line l_1. Prove that in the family L there are two lines l and l' such that the following 2 conditions are satisfied simultaneously: 1) The line l is bounding the line l'; 2) the line l' is not bounding the line l.
