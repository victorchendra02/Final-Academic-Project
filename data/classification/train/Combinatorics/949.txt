Suppose we have a n-gon. Some n-3 diagonals are coloured black and some other n-3 diagonals are coloured red (a side is not a diagonal), so that no two diagonals of the same colour can intersect strictly inside the polygon, although they can share a vertex. Find the maximum number of intersection points between diagonals coloured differently strictly inside the polygon, in terms of n. Proposed by Alexander Ivanov, Bulgaria
