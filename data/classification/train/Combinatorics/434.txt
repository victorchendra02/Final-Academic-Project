A pm 1-sequence is a sequence of 2022 numbers a_1, ldots, a_{2022}, each equal to either +1 or -1. Determine the largest C so that, for any pm 1-sequence, there exists an integer k and indices 1 le t_1 < ldots < t_k le 2022 so that t_{i+1} - t_i le 2 for all i, and left| sum_{i+1}^{k} a_{t_i} right| ge C.
