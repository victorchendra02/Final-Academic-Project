N teams take part in a league. Every team plays every other team exactly once during the league, and receives 2 points for each win, 1 point for each draw, and 0 points for each loss. At the end of the league, the sequence of total points in descending order mathcal{A} = (a_1 ge a_2 ge cdots ge a_N ) is known, as well as which team obtained which score. Find the number of sequences mathcal{A} such that the outcome of all matches is uniquely determined by this information. Proposed by Dominic Yeo, United Kingdom.
