Let c_1, ldots, c_n in mathbb{R} with n geq 2 such that 0 leq sum^n_{i=1} c_i leq n. Show that we can find integers k_1, ldots, k_n such that sum^n_{i=1} k_i = 0 and 1-n leq c_i + n cdot k_i leq n for every i = 1, ldots, n. Another formulation:Let x_1, ldots, x_n, with n geq 2 be real numbers such that |x_1 + ldots + x_n| leq n. Show that there exist integers k_1, ldots, k_n such that |k_1 + ldots + k_n| = 0. and |x_i + 2 cdot n cdot k_i| leq 2 cdot n -1 for every i = 1, ldots, n. In order to prove this, denote c_i = frac{1+x_i}{2} for i = 1, ldots, n, etc.
