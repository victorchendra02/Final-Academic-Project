Let p > 3 be a prime number, and let F_p denote the (finite) set of residue classes modulo p. Let S_d denote the set of 2-variable polynomials P(x, y) with coefficients in F_p, total degree le d, and satisfying P(x, y) = P(y,- x -y). Show that |S_d| = p^{ lceil (d+1)(d+2)/6 rceil}. The total degree of a 2-variable polynomial P(x, y) is the largest value of i + j among monomials x^iy^j appearing in P.
