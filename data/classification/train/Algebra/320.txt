We consider the following system with q=2p: begin{matrix} a_{11}x_{1}+ ldots+a_{1q}x_{q}=0, a_{21}x_{1}+ ldots+a_{2q}x_{q}=0, ldots , a_{p1}x_{1}+ ldots+a_{pq}x_{q}=0, end{matrix} in which every coefficient is an element from the set {-1,0,1 }. Prove that there exists a solution x_{1}, ldots,x_{q} for the system with the properties: a.) all x_{j}, j=1, ldots,q are integers; b.) there exists at least one j for which x_{j} neq 0; c.) |x_{j}| leq q for any j=1, ldots ,q.$
