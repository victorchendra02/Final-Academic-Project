Consider an integer n ge 4 and a sequence of real numbers x_1, x_2, x_3,..., x_n. An operation consists in eliminating all numbers not having the rank of the form 4k + 3, thus leaving only the numbers x_3. x_7. x_{11}, ...(for example, the sequence 4,5,9,3,6, 6,1, 8 produces the sequence 9,1). Upon the sequence 1, 2, 3, ..., 1024 the operation is performed successively for 5 times. Show that at the end only one number remains and find this number.
