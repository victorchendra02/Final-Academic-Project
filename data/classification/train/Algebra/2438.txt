Find, with proof, the smallest real number C with the following property: For every infinite sequence {x_i } of positive real numbers such that x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_n leq x_{n+1} for n = 1, 2, 3, cdots, we have sqrt{x_1}+ sqrt{x_2}+ cdots+ sqrt{x_n} leq C sqrt{x_1+x_2+ cdots+x_n} qquad forall n in mathbb N.
