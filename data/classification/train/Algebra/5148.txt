(a) Prove that for all a, b, c, d in mathbb{R} with a + b + c + d = 0, max(a, b) + max(a, c) + max(a, d) + max(b, c) + max(b, d) + max(c, d) geqslant 0. (b) Find the largest non-negative integer k such that it is possible to replace k of the six maxima in this inequality by minima in such a way that the inequality still holds for all a, b, c, d in mathbb{R} with a + b + c + d = 0.
