Let n be a positive integer and let (x_1, ldots,x_n), (y_1, ldots,y_n) be two sequences of positive real numbers. Suppose (z_2, ldots,z_{2n}) is a sequence of positive real numbers such that z_{i+j}^2 geq x_iy_j for all 1 le i,j leq n. Let M= max {z_2, ldots,z_{2n} }. Prove that left( frac{M+z_2+ dots+z_{2n}}{2n} right)^2 ge left( frac{x_1+ dots+x_n}{n} right) left( frac{y_1+ dots+y_n}{n} right). commentEdited by Orl. Proposed by Reid Barton, USA
