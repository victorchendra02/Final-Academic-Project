The sequence c_{0}, c_{1}, . . . , c_{n}, . . . is defined by c_{0}= 1, c_{1}= 0, and c_{n+2}= c_{n+1}+c_{n} for n geq 0. Consider the set S of ordered pairs (x, y) for which there is a finite set J of positive integers such that x= textstyle sum_{j in J}{c_{j}}, y= textstyle sum_{j in J}{c_{j-1}}. Prove that there exist real numbers alpha, beta, and M with the following property: An ordered pair of nonnegative integers (x, y) satisfies the inequality m < alpha x+ beta y < M if and only if (x, y) in S. Remark: A sum over the elements of the empty set is assumed to be 0.
