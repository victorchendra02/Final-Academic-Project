Let P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + 1 be a polynomial with real coefficients and three real roots rho_1, rho_2, rho_3 such that | rho_1| < | rho_2| < | rho_3|. Let A be the point where the graph of P(x) intersects yy' and the point B( rho_1, 0), C( rho_2, 0), D( rho_3, 0). If the circumcircle of vartriangle ABD intersects yy' for a second time at E, find the minimum value of the length of the segment EC and the polynomials for which this is attained.
