We consider two sequences of real numbers x_{1} geq x_{2} geq ldots geq x_{n} and y_{1} geq y_{2} geq ldots geq y_{n}. Let z_{1}, z_{2}, . ldots, z_{n} be a permutation of the numbers y_{1}, y_{2}, ldots, y_{n}. Prove that sum limits_{i=1}^{n} ( x_{i} - y_{i} )^{2} leq sum limits_{i=1}^{n} ( x_{i} - z_{i})^{2}.
