Let E be a finite set, P_E the family of its subsets, and f a mapping from P_E to the set of non-negative reals, such that for any two disjoint subsets A,B of E, f(A cup B)=f(A)+f(B). Prove that there exists a subset F of E such that if with each A subset E, we associate a subset A' consisting of elements of A that are not in F, then f(A)=f(A') and f(A) is zero if and only if A is a subset of F.
