Consider the sytem of equations a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+a_{13}x_3 = 0 a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+a_{23}x_3 =0a_{31}x_1+a_{32}x_2+a_{33}x_3 = 0 with unknowns x_1, x_2, x_3. The coefficients satisfy the conditions: a) a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33} are positive numbers; b) the remaining coefficients are negative numbers; c) in each equation, the sum ofthe coefficients is positive. Prove that the given system has only the solution x_1=x_2=x_3=0.
