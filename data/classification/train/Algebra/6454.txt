Let mathcal{H}_n be the set of all numbers of the form 2 pm sqrt{2 pm sqrt{2 pm ldots pm sqrt 2}} where "root signs" appear n times. (a) Prove that all the elements of mathcal{H}_n are real. (b) Computer the product of the elements of mathcal{H}_n. (c) The elements of mathcal{H}_{11} are arranged in a row, and are sorted by size in an ascending order. Find the position in that row, of the elements of mathcal{H}_{11} that corresponds to the following combination of pm signs: +++++-++-+-
