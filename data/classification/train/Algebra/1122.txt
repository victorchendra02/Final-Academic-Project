For n geq 3 and a_{1} leq a_{2} leq ldots leq a_{n} given real numbers we have the following instructions: - place out the numbers in some order in a ring; - delete one of the numbers from the ring; - if just two numbers are remaining in the ring: let S be the sum of these two numbers. Otherwise, if there are more the two numbers in the ring, replace Afterwards start again with the step (2). Show that the largest sum S which can result in this way is given by the formula S_{max}= sum^n_{k=2} begin{pmatrix} n -2 [ frac{k}{2}] - 1 end{pmatrix}a_{k}.
