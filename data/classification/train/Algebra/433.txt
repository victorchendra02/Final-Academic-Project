For a positive integer n, an n-sequence is a sequence (a_0, ldots,a_n) of non-negative integers satisfying the following condition: if i and j are non-negative integers with i+j leqslant n, then a_i+a_j leqslant n and a_{a_i+a_j}=a_{i+j}. Let f(n) be the number of n-sequences. Prove that there exist positive real numbers c_1, c_2, and lambda such that c_1 lambda^n<f(n)<c_2 lambda^nfor all positive integers n.
