Let n>1 be a given integer. The Mint issues coins of n different values a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each a_i is a positive integer (the number of coins of each value is unlimited). A set of values {a_1, a_2,..., a_n } is called lucky, if the sum a_1+ a_2+...+ a_n can be collected in a unique way (namely, by taking one coin of each value). (a) Prove that there exists a lucky set of values {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n } with a_1+ a_2+...+ a_n < n cdot 2^n.(b) Prove that every lucky set of values {a_1, a_2,..., a_n } satisfies a_1+ a_2+...+ a_n >n cdot 2^{n-1}.
