For a polynomial P of degree 2000 with distinct real coefficients let M(P) be the set of all polynomials that can be produced from P by permutation of its coefficients. A polynomial P will be called n-independent if P(n) = 0 and we can get from any Q in M(P) a polynomial Q_1 such that Q_1(n) = 0 by interchanging at most one pair of coefficients of Q. Find all integers n for which n-independent polynomials exist.
