Let a,b,c be real numbers with a non-zero. It is known that the real numbers x_1,x_2, ldots,x_n satisfy the n equations: ax_1^2+bx_1+c = x_{2} ax_2^2+bx_2 +c = x_3 ldots quad ldots quad ldots quad ldots ax_n^2+bx_n+c = x_1 Prove that the system has zero, one or more than one real solutions if (b-1)^2-4ac$ is negative, equal to zero or positive respectively.
