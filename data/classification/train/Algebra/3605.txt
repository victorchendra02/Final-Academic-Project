Determine all functions f: mathbb{R} to mathbb{R}, where mathbb{R} is the set of all real numbers, satisfying the following two conditions: 1) There exists a real number M such that for every real number x,f(x)<M is satisfied. 2) For every pair of real numbers x and y, f(xf(y))+yf(x)=xf(y)+f(xy) is satisfied.
