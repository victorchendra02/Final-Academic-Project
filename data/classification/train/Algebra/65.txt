Let mathbb Q_{>0} be the set of all positive rational numbers. Let f: mathbb Q_{>0} to mathbb R be a function satisfying the following three conditions: (i) for all x,y in mathbb Q_{>0}, we have f(x)f(y) geq f(xy); (ii) for all x,y in mathbb Q_{>0}, we have f(x+y) geq f(x)+f(y); (iii) there exists a rational number a>1 such that f(a)=a. Prove that f(x)=x for all x in mathbb Q_{>0}. Proposed by Bulgaria
