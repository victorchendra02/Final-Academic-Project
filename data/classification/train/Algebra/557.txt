Given any set S of positive integers, show that at least one of the following two assertions holds: (1) There exist distinct finite subsets F and G of S such that sum_{x in F}1/x= sum_{x in G}1/x; (2) There exists a positive rational number r<1 such that sum_{x in F}1/x neq r for all finite subsets F of S.
