A polynomial Q (x) = k_n x ^ n + k_ {n-1} x ^ {n-1} + ldots + k_1 x + k_0 with real coefficients is called powerful if the equality | k_0 | = | k_1 | + | k_2 | + ldots + | k_ {n-1} | + | k_n | , and non-increasing , if k_0 geq k_1 geq ldots geq k_ {n-1} geq k_n . Let for the polynomial P (x) = a_d x ^ d + a_ {d-1} x ^ {d-1} + ldots + a_1 x + a_0 with nonzero real coefficients, where a_d> 0 , the polynomial P (x) (x-1) ^ t (x + 1) ^ s is powerful for some non-negative integers s and t ( s + t> 0 ). Prove that at least one of the polynomials P (x) and (- 1) ^ d P (-x) is nonincreasing.
