Consider the sequence (a_n)_{n ge 1} defined by a_n=n for n in {1,2,3.4,5,6 }, and for n ge 7: a_n={ lfloor} frac{a_1+a_2+...+a_{n-1}}{2}{ rfloor}where { lfloor}x{ rfloor} is the greatest integer less than or equal to x. For example : { lfloor}2.4{ rfloor} = 2, { lfloor}3{ rfloor} = 3 and { lfloor} pi { rfloor}= 3. For all integers n ge 2, let S_n = {a_1,a_1,...,a_n }- {r_n } where r_n is the remainder when a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n is divided by 3. The minus - denotes the ''remove it if it is there'' notation. For example : S_4 = {2,3,4} because r_4= 1 so 1 is removed from {1,2,3,4 }. However S_5= {1,2,3,4,5 } betawe r_5 = 0 and 0 is not in the set {1,2,3,4,5 }. 1. Determine S_7,S_8,S_9 and S_{10}. 2. We say that a set S_n for n ge 6 is well-balanced if it can be partitioned into three pairwise disjoint subsets with equal sum. For example : S_6 = {1,2,3,4,5,6 } = {1,6 } cup {2,5 } cup {3,4 } and 1 +6 = 2 + 5 = 3 + 4. Prove that S_7,S_8,S_9 and S_{10} are well-balanced . 3. Is the set S_{2019} well-balanced? Justify your answer.
