Let A be a non-empty set of positive integers. Suppose that there are positive integers b_1, ldots b_n and c_1, ldots,c_n such that - for each i the set b_iA+c_i= left {b_ia+c_i colon a in A right } is a subset of A, and - the sets b_iA+c_i and b_jA+c_j are disjoint whenever i ne j Prove that {1 over b_1}+ , ldots ,+{1 over b_n} leq1.
