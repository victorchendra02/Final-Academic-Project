Consider pairs of the sequences of positive real numbers a_1 geq a_2 geq a_3 geq cdots, qquad b_1 geq b_2 geq b_3 geq cdotsand the sums A_n = a_1 + cdots + a_n, quad B_n = b_1 + cdots + b_n; qquad n = 1,2, ldots.For any pair define c_n = min {a_i,b_i } and C_n = c_1 + cdots + c_n, n=1,2, ldots. (1) Does there exist a pair (a_i)_{i geq 1}, (b_i)_{i geq 1} such that the sequences (A_n)_{n geq 1} and (B_n)_{n geq 1} are unbounded while the sequence (C_n)_{n geq 1} is bounded? (2) Does the answer to question (1) change by assuming additionally that b_i = 1/i, i=1,2, ldots? Justify your answer.
