A nonempty set A of real numbers is called a B_3-set if the conditions a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6 in A and a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = a_4 + a_5 + a_6 imply that the sequences (a_1, a_2, a_3) and (a_4, a_5, a_6) are identical up to a permutation. Let A = {a_0 = 0 < a_1 < a_2 < cdots }, B = {b_0 = 0 < b_1 < b_2 < cdots } be infinite sequences of real numbers with D(A) = D(B), where, for a set X of real numbers, D(X) denotes the difference set {|x-y| mid x, y in X }. Prove that if A is a B_3-set, then A = B.
