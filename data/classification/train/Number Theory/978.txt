Let p be an odd prime and n a positive integer. In the coordinate plane, eight distinct points with integer coordinates lie on a circle with diameter of length p^{n}. Prove that there exists a triangle with vertices at three of the given points such that the squares of its side lengths are integers divisible by p^{n+1}. Proposed by Alexander Ivanov, Bulgaria
