Denote by d(n) the number of divisors of the positive integer n. A positive integer n is called highly divisible if d(n) > d(m) for all positive integers m < n. Two highly divisible integers m and n with m < n are called consecutive if there exists no highly divisible integer s satisfying m < s < n. (a) Show that there are only finitely many pairs of consecutive highly divisible integers of the form (a, b) with a mid b. (b) Show that for every prime number p there exist infinitely many positive highly divisible integers r such that pr is also highly divisible.
