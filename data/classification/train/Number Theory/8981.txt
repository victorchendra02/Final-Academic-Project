Ana and Bety play a game alternating turns. Initially, Ana chooses an odd possitive integer and composite n such that 2^j<n<2^{j+1} with 2<j. In her first turn Bety chooses an odd composite integer n_1 such that n_1 leq frac{1^n+2^n+ dots+(n-1)^n}{2(n-1)^{n-1}}.Then, on her other turn, Ana chooses a prime number p_1 that divides n_1. If the prime that Ana chooses is 3, 5 or 7, the Ana wins; otherwise Bety chooses an odd composite positive integer n_2 such that n_2 leq frac{1^{p_1}+2^{p_1}+ dots+(p_1-1)^{p_1}}{2(p_1-1)^{p_1-1}}.After that, on her turn, Ana chooses a prime p_2 that divides n_2,, if p_2 is 3, 5, or 7, Ana wins, otherwise the process repeats. Also, Ana wins if at any time Bety cannot choose an odd composite positive integer in the corresponding range. Bety wins if she manages to play at least j-1 turns. Find which of the two players has a winning strategy.
