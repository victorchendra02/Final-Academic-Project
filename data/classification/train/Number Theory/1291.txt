Let S be the set of all pairs (m,n) of relatively prime positive integers m,n with n even and m < n. For s = (m,n) in S write n = 2^k cdot n_o where k, n_0 are positive integers with n_0 odd and define f(s) = (n_0, m + n - n_0). Prove that f is a function from S to S and that for each s = (m,n) in S, there exists a positive integer t leq frac{m+n+1}{4} such that f^t(s) = s, where f^t(s) = underbrace{ (f circ f circ cdots circ f) }_{t text{ times}}(s). If m+n is a prime number which does not divide 2^k - 1 for k = 1,2, ldots, m+n-2, prove that the smallest value t which satisfies the above conditions is left [ frac{m+n+1}{4} right ] where left[ x right] denotes the greatest integer leq x.
