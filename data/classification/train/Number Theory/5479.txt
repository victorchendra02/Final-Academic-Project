An integer n>1 , whose positive divisors are 1=d_1<d_2< cdots <d_k=n, is called textit{southern} if all the numbers d_2-d_1, d_3- d_2 , cdots, d_k-d_{k-1} are divisors of n. a) Find a positive integer that is textit{not southern} and has exactly 2022 positive divisors that are textit{southern}. b) Show that there are infinitely many positive integers that are textit{not southern} and have exactly 2022 positive divisors that are textit{southern}.
