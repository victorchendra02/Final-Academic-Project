Let n geq2 be an integer. An n-tuple (a_1,a_2, dots,a_n) of not necessarily different positive integers is expensive if there exists a positive integer k such that (a_1+a_2)(a_2+a_3) dots(a_{n-1}+a_n)(a_n+a_1)=2^{2k-1}.a) Find all integers n geq2 for which there exists an expensive n-tuple. b) Prove that for every odd positive integer m there exists an integer n geq2 such that m belongs to an expensive n-tuple. There are exactly n factors in the product on the left hand side.
