Denote by S the set of all primes such the decimal representation of frac{1}{p} has the fundamental period divisible by 3. For every p in S such that frac{1}{p} has the fundamental period 3r one may write frac{1}{p}=0,a_{1}a_{2} ldots a_{3r}a_{1}a_{2} ldots a_{3r} ldots , where r=r(p); for every p in S and every integer k geq 1 define f(k,p) by f(k,p)= a_{k}+a_{k+r(p)}+a_{k+2.r(p)} a) Prove that S is infinite. b) Find the highest value of f(k,p) for k geq 1 and p in S
