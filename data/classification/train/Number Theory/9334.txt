Given natural numbers a,b and function f: mathbb{N} to mathbb{N} such that for any natural number n, f left( n+a right) is divided by f left( { left[ { sqrt n } right] + b} right). Prove that for any natural n exist n pairwise distinct and pairwise relatively prime natural numbers {{a}_{1}}, {{a}_{2}}, ldots, {{a}_{n}} such that the number f left( {{a}_{i+1}} right) is divided by f left( {{a}_{i}} right) for each i=1,2, dots ,n-1 . (Here [x] is the integer part of number x, that is, the largest integer not exceeding x.)
