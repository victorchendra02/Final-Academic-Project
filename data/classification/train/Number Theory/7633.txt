Let a, b be two co-prime positive integers. A number is called good if it can be written in the form ax + by for non-negative integers x, y. Define the function f : Z to Z as f(n) = n - n_a - n_b, where s_t represents the remainder of s upon division by t. Show that an integer n is good if and only if the infinite sequence n, f(n), f(f(n)), ... contains only non-negative integers.
