Determine all pairs of positive integers (m, n) for which there exists a bijective function f : mathbb{Z}_m times mathbb{Z}_n to mathbb{Z}_m times mathbb{Z}_nsuch that the vectors f( mathbf{v}) + mathbf{v}, as mathbf{v} runs through all of mathbb{Z}_m times mathbb{Z}_n, are pairwise distinct. (For any integers a and b, the vectors [a, b], [a + m, b] and [a, b + n] are treated as equal.) Poland, Wojciech Nadara
