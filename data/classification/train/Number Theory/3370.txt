(FRA 6) Consider the integer d = frac{a^b-1}{c}, where a, b, and c are positive integers and c le a. Prove that the set G of integers that are between 1 and d and relatively prime to d (the number of such integers is denoted by phi(d)) can be partitioned into n subsets, each of which consists of b elements. What can be said about the rational number frac{ phi(d)}{b}?
