Let n be a given number greater than 2. We consider the set V_n of all the integers of the form 1 + kn with k = 1, 2, ldots A number m from V_n is called indecomposable in V_n if there are not two numbers p and q from V_n so that m = pq. Prove that there exist a number r in V_n that can be expressed as the product of elements indecomposable in V_n in more than one way. (Expressions which differ only in order of the elements of V_n will be considered the same.)
