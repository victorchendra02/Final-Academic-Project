Let p be a prime number, and X be the set of cubes modulo p, including 0. Denote by C_2(k) the number of ordered pairs (x, y) in X times X such that x + y equiv k pmod p. Likewise, denote by C_3(k) the number of ordered pairs (x, y, z) in X times X times X such that x + y + z equiv k pmod p. Prove that there are integers a, b such that for all k not in X, we have C_3(k) = a cdot C_2(k) + b. Proposed by Murilo Corato, Brazil.
