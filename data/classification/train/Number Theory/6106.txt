An infinite sequence of positive integers a_1, a_2, dots is called good if (1) a_1 is a perfect square, and (2) for any integer n ge 2, a_n is the smallest positive integer such that na_1 + (n-1)a_2 + dots + 2a_{n-1} + a_nis a perfect square. Prove that for any good sequence a_1, a_2, dots, there exists a positive integer k such that a_n=a_k for all integers n ge k. (reposting because the other thread didn't get moved)
