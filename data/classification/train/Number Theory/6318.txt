1- Find a pair (m,n) of positive integers such that K = |2^m-3^n| in all of this cases : a) K=5 b) K=11 c) K=19 2-Is there a pair (m,n) of positive integers such that : |2^m-3^n| = 20173-Every prime number less than 41 can be represented in the form |2^m-3^n| by taking an Appropriate pair (m,n) of positive integers. Prove that the number 41 cannot be represented in the form |2^m-3^n| where m and n are positive integers 4-Note that 2^5+3^2=41 . The number 53 is the least prime number that cannot be represented as a sum or an difference of a power of 2 and a power of 3 . Prove that the number 53 cannot be represented in any of the forms 2^m-3^n , 3^n-2^m , 2^m-3^n where m and n are positive integers
