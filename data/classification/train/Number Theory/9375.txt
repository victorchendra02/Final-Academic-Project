A subset S of the set M= {1,2,.....,p-1 },where p is a prime number of the kind 12n+11,is essential,if the product { Pi}_s of all elements of the subset is not less than the product bar{{ Pi}_s} of all other elements of the set.The difference bigtriangleup_s= Pi_s- bar{{ Pi}_s} is called the deviation of the subset S.Define the least possible remainder of division by p of the deviation of an essential subset,containing frac{p-1}{2} elements.
