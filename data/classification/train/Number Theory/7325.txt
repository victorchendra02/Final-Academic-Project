Dragos, the early ruler of Moldavia, and Maria the Oracle play the following game. Firstly, Maria chooses a set S of prime numbers. Then Dragos gives an infinite sequence x_1, x_2, ... of distinct positive integers. Then Maria picks a positive integer M and a prime number p from her set S. Finally, Dragos picks a positive integer N and the game ends. Dragos wins if and only if for all integers n ge N the number x_n is divisible by p^M; otherwise, Maria wins. Who has a winning strategy if the set S must be: hspace{5px}a) finite; hspace{5px}b) infinite? Proposed by Boris Stankovic, Bosnia and Herzegovina
