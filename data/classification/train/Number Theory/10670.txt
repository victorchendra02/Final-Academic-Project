Does the system of equation begin{align*} begin{cases} x_1 + x_2 &= y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 x_1^2 + x_2^2 &= y_1^2 + y_2^2 + y_3^2 + y_4^2 x_1^3 + x_2^3 &= y_1^3 + y_2^3 + y_3^3 + y_4^3 end{cases} end{align*}admit a solution in integers such that the absolute value of each of these integers is greater than 2020?
