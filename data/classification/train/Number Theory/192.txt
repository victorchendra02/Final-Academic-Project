For each positive integer ,n, ;S(n) , is defined to be the greatest integer such that, for every positive integer ,k leq S(n), ;n^{2} , can be written as the sum of ,k , positive squares. a.) Prove that ,S(n) leq n^{2}-14 , for each ,n geq 4. b.) Find an integer ,n , such that ,S(n)=n^{2}-14. c.) Prove that there are infintely many integers ,n , such that S(n)=n^{2}-14.
