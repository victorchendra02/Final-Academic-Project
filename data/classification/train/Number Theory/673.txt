Let mathbb{Z}_{>0} denote the set of positive integers. Consider a function f: mathbb{Z}_{>0} to mathbb{Z}_{>0}. For any m, n in mathbb{Z}_{>0} we write f^n(m) = underbrace{f(f( ldots f}_{n}(m) ldots)). Suppose that f has the following two properties: (i) if m, n in mathbb{Z}_{>0}, then frac{f^n(m) - m}{n} in mathbb{Z}_{>0}; (ii) The set mathbb{Z}_{>0} setminus {f(n) mid n in mathbb{Z}_{>0} } is finite. Prove that the sequence f(1) - 1, f(2) - 2, f(3) - 3, ldots is periodic. Proposed by Ang Jie Jun, Singapore
