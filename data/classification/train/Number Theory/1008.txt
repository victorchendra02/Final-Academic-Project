Let p be a prime number and let A be a set of positive integers that satisfies the following conditions: (i) the set of prime divisors of the elements in A consists of p-1 elements; (ii) for any nonempty subset of A, the product of its elements is not a perfect p-th power. What is the largest possible number of elements in A ?
