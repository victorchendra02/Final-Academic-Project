Let left { {{a}_{n}} right }_{n geq 1} and left { {{b}_{n}} right }_{n geq 1} be two infinite arithmetic progressions, each of which the first term and the difference are mutually prime natural numbers. It is known that for any natural n, at least one of the numbers left( a_n^2+a_{n+1}^2 right) left( b_n^2+b_{n+1}^2 right) or left( a_n^2+b_n^2 right) left( a_{n+1}^2+b_{n+1}^2 right) is an perfect square. Prove that {{a}_{n}}={{b}_{n}}, for any natural n .
