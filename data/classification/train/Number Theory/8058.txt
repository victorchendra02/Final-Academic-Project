For a positive integer n with prime factorization n = p_1^{ alpha_1}p_2^{ alpha_2} cdots p_k^{ alpha_k} let's define lambda(n) = (-1)^{ alpha_1 + alpha_2 + dots + alpha_k}. Define L(n) as sum of lambda(x) over all integers from 1 to n. Define K(n) as sum of lambda(x) over all composite integers from 1 to n. For some N>1, we know, that for every 2 le n le N, L(n) le 0. Prove that for this N, for every 2 le n le N, K(n) ge 0. Mykhailo Shtandenko
