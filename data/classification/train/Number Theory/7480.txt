Vukasin, Dimitrije, Dusan, Stefan and Filip asked their teacher to guess three consecutive positive integers, after these true statements: Vukasin: " The sum of the digits of one number is prime number. The sum of the digits of another of the other two is, an even perfect number.(n is perfect if sigma left(n right)=2n). The sum of the digits of the third number equals to the number of it's positive divisors". Dimitrije:"Everyone of those three numbers has at most two digits equal to 1 in their decimal representation". Dusan:"If we add 11 to exactly one of them, then we have a perfect square of an integer" Stefan:"Everyone of them has exactly one prime divisor less than 10". Filip:"The three numbers are square free". Professor found the right answer. Which numbers did he mention?
