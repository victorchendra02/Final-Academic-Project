Albert and Beatrice play a game. 2021 stones lie on a table. Starting with Albert, they alternatively remove stones from the table, while obeying the following rule. At the n-th turn, the active player (Albert if n is odd, Beatrice if n is even) can remove from 1 to n stones. Thus, Albert first removes 1 stone; then, Beatrice can remove 1 or 2 stones, as she wishes; then, Albert can remove from 1 to 3 stones, and so on. The player who removes the last stone on the table loses, and the other one wins. Which player has a strategy to win regardless of the other player's moves?
