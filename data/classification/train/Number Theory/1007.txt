The sequence a_0, a_1, a_2, ldots is defined as follows: a_0=2, qquad a_{k+1}=2a_k^2-1 quad text{for }k geq 0.Prove that if an odd prime p divides a_n, then 2^{n+3} divides p^2-1. commentHi guys , Here is a nice problem: Let be given a sequence a_n such that a_0=2 and a_{n+1}=2a_n^2-1 . Show that if p is an odd prime such that p|a_n then we have p^2 equiv 1 pmod{2^{n+3}} Here are some futher question proposed by me :Prove or disprove that : 1) gcd(n,a_n)=1 2) for every odd prime number p we have a_m equiv pm 1 pmod{p} where m= frac{p^2-1}{2^k} where k=1 or 2 Thanks kiu si u Edited by Orl.
