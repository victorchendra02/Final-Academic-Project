Let S subset { 1, dots, n } be a nonempty set, where n is a positive integer. We denote by s the greatest common divisor of the elements of the set S. We assume that s not= 1 and let d be its smallest divisor greater than 1. Let T subset { 1, dots, n } be a set such that S subset T and |T| ge 1 + left[ frac{n}{d} right]. Prove that the greatest common divisor of the elements in T is 1. [Second Version] Let n(n ge 1) be a positive integer and U = { 1, dots, n }. Let S be a nonempty subset of U and let d (d not= 1) be the smallest common divisor of all elements of the set S. Find the smallest positive integer k such that for any subset T of U, consisting of k elements, with S subset T, the greatest common divisor of all elements of T is equal to 1.
