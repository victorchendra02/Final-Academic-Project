A finite sequence of integers a_0, a_1, ldots, a_n is called quadratic if for each i in the set {1,2 ldots, n } we have the equality |a_i - a_{i-1}| = i^2. a.) Prove that any two integers b and c, there exists a natural number n and a quadratic sequence with a_0 = b and a_n = c. b.) Find the smallest natural number n for which there exists a quadratic sequence with a_0 = 0 and a_n = 1996.
