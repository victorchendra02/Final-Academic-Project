Consider the set A = left {1+ frac{1}{k} : k=1,2,3,4, cdots right }. Prove that every integer x geq 2 can be written as the product of one or more elements of A, which are not necessarily different. For every integer x geq 2 let f(x) denote the minimum integer such that x can be written as the product of f(x) elements of A, which are not necessarily different. Prove that there exist infinitely many pairs (x,y) of integers with x geq 2, y geq 2, and f(xy)<f(x)+f(y).(Pairs (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) are different if x_1 neq x_2 or y_1 neq y_2).
