Let ABC be an acute angled triangle with orthocenter {H} and circumcenter {O}. Assume the circumcenter {X} of {BHC} lies on the circumcircle of {ABC}. Reflect O across {X} to obtain {O'}, and let the lines {XH}and {O'A} meet at {K}. Let L,M and N be the midpoints of left[ XB right], left[ XC right] and left[ BC right], respectively. Prove that the points K,L,M and {N} are concyclic.
