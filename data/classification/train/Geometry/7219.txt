Let P be an arbitrary point in the interior of triangle triangle ABC. Lines overline{BP} and overline{CP} intersect overline{AC} and overline{AB} at E and F, respectively. Let K and L be the midpoints of the segments BF and CE, respectively. Let the lines through L and K parallel to overline{CF} and overline{BE} intersect overline{BC} at S and T, respectively; moreover, denote by M and N the reflection of S and T over the points L and K, respectively. Prove that as P moves in the interior of triangle triangle ABC, line overline{MN} passes through a fixed point. Proposed by Ali Zamani
