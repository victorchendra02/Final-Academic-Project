In triangle ABC let A', B', C' respectively be the midpoints of the sides BC, CA, AB. Furthermore let L, M, N be the projections of the orthocenter on the three sides BC, CA, AB, and let k denote the nine-point circle. The lines AA', BB', CC' intersect k in the points D, E, F. The tangent lines on k in D, E, F intersect the lines MN, LN and LM in the points P, Q, R. Prove that P, Q and R are collinear.
