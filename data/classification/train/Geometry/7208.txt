Given a convex quadrilateral ABCD with AB = BC and angle ABD = angle BCD = 90.Let point E be the intersection of diagonals AC and BD. Point F lies on the side AD such that frac{AF}{F D}= frac{CE}{EA}.. Circle omega with diameter DF and the circumcircle of triangle ABF intersect for the second time at point K. Point L is the second intersection of EF and omega. Prove that the line KL passes through the midpoint of CE. Proposed by Mahdi Etesamifard and Amir Parsa Hosseini - Iran
