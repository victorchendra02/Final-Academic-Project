i.) Consider a circle K with diameter AB; with circle L tangent to AB and to K and with a circle M tangent to circle K, circle L and AB. Calculate the ration of the area of circle K to the area of circle M. ii.) In triangle ABC, AB = AC and angle CAB = 80^{ circ}. If points D,E and F lie on sides BC, AC and AB, respectively and CE = CD and BF = BD, then find the size of angle EDF.
