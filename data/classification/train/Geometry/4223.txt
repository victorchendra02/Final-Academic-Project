Let ABC (BC > AC) be an acute triangle with circumcircle k centered at O. The tangent to k at C intersects the line AB at the point D. The circumcircles of triangles BCD, OCD and AOB intersect the ray CA (beyond A) at the points Q, P and K, respectively, such that P in (AK) and K in (PQ). The line PD intersects the circumcircle of triangle BKQ at the point T, so that P and T are in different halfplanes with respect to BQ. Prove that TB = TQ.
