Let k and k' be concentric circles with center O and radius R and R' where R<R' holds. A line passing through O intersects k at A and k' at B where O is between A and B. Another line passing through O and distict from AB intersects k at E and k' at F where E is between O and F. Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles OAE and OBF, the circle with diameter EF and the circle with diameter AB are concurrent.
