ABC is an equilateral triangle. A_{1}, B_{1}, C_{1} are the midpoints of BC, CA, AB respectively. p is an arbitrary line through A_{1}. q and r are lines parallel to p through B_{1} and C_{1} respectively. p meets the line B_{1}C_{1} at A_{2}. Similarly, q meets C_{1}A_{1} at B_{2}, and r meets A_{1}B_{1} at C_{2}. Show that the lines AA_{2}, BB_{2}, CC_{2} meet at some point X, and that X lies on the circumcircle of ABC.
