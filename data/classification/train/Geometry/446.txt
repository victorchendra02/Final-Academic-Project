Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle with AC > AB, let O be its circumcentre, and let D be a point on the segment BC. The line through D perpendicular to BC intersects the lines AO, AC, and AB at W, X, and Y, respectively. The circumcircles of triangles AXY and ABC intersect again at Z ne A. Prove that if W ne D and OW = OD, then DZ is tangent to the circle AXY.
