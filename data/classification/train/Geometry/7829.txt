Let points A, B, C, A', B', C' be chosen in the plane such that no three of them are collinear, and let lines AA', BB' and CC' be tangent to a given equilateral hyperbola at points A, B and C, respectively. Assume that the circumcircle of A'B'C' is the same as the nine-point circle of triangle ABC. Let s(A') be the Simson line of point A' with respect to the orthic triangle of ABC. Let A^* be the intersection of line B'C' and the perpendicular on s(A') from the point A. Points B^* and C^* are defined in a similar manner. Prove that points A^*, B^* and C^* are collinear.
