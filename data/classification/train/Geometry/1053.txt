Let ABC be a triangle and P an exterior point in the plane of the triangle. Suppose the lines AP, BP, CP meet the sides BC, CA, AB (or extensions thereof) in D, E, F, respectively. Suppose further that the areas of triangles PBD, PCE, PAF are all equal. Prove that each of these areas is equal to the area of triangle ABC itself.
