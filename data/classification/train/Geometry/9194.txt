The incircle of a scalene triangle ABC touches the sides BC, CA, and AB at points D, E, and F, respectively. Triangles APE and AQF are constructed outside the triangle so that AP =PE, AQ=QF, angle APE= angle ACB, text{ and } angle AQF = angle ABC.Let M be the midpoint of BC. Find angle QMP in terms of the angles of the triangle ABC. Iran, Shayan Talaei
