Let ABCD be a trapezoid with parallel sides AB > CD. Points K and L lie on the line segments AB and CD, respectively, so that AK/KB=DL/LC. Suppose that there are points P and Q on the line segment KL satisfying angle{APB} = angle{BCD} qquad text{and} qquad angle{CQD} = angle{ABC}.Prove that the points P, Q, B and C are concyclic.
