Circles Omega_1 and Omega_2 with different radii intersect at two points, denote one of them by P. A variable line l passing through P intersects the arc of Omega_1 which is outside of Omega_2 at X_1, and the arc of Omega_2 which is outside of Omega_1 at X_2. Let R be the point on segment X_1X_2 such that X_1P = RX_2. The tangent to Omega_1 through X_1 meets the tangent to Omega_2 through X_2 at T. Prove that line RT/is tangent to a fixed circle, independent of the choice of l.
