Consider a cone of revolution with an inscribed sphere tangent to the base of the cone. A cylinder is circumscribed about this sphere so that one of its bases lies in the base of the cone. let V_1 be the volume of the cone and V_2 be the volume of the cylinder. a) Prove that V_1 neq V_2; b) Find the smallest number k for which V_1=kV_2; for this case, construct the angle subtended by a diamter of the base of the cone at the vertex of the cone.
