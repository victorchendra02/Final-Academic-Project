Consider triangle OAB with acute angle AOB. Thorugh a point M neq O perpendiculars are drawn to OA and OB, the feet of which are P and Q respectively. The point of intersection of the altitudes of triangle OPQ is H. What is the locus of H if M is permitted to range over a) the side AB; b) the interior of triangle OAB.
