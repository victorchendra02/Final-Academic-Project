Let P be a convex polygon. Prove that there exists a convex hexagon that is contained in P and whose area is at least frac34 of the area of the polygon P. Alternative version. Let P be a convex polygon with n geq 6 vertices. Prove that there exists a convex hexagon with a) vertices on the sides of the polygon (or) b) vertices among the vertices of the polygon such that the area of the hexagon is at least frac{3}{4} of the area of the polygon.
