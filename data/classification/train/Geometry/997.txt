Let Gamma_1, Gamma_2, Gamma_3, Gamma_4 be distinct circles such that Gamma_1, Gamma_3 are externally tangent at P, and Gamma_2, Gamma_4 are externally tangent at the same point P. Suppose that Gamma_1 and Gamma_2; Gamma_2 and Gamma_3; Gamma_3 and Gamma_4; Gamma_4 and Gamma_1 meet at A, B, C, D, respectively, and that all these points are different from P. Prove that frac{AB cdot BC}{AD cdot DC}= frac{PB^2}{PD^2}.
