Let ABC be a triangle with circumcircle Omega and incentre I. A line ell intersects the lines AI, BI, and CI at points D, E, and F, respectively, distinct from the points A, B, C, and I. The perpendicular bisectors x, y, and z of the segments AD, BE, and CF, respectively determine a triangle Theta. Show that the circumcircle of the triangle Theta is tangent to Omega.
