Let ABC be a triangle. Prove that there exists a point D on the side AB of the triangle ABC, such that CD is the geometric mean of AD and DB, iff the triangle ABC satisfies the inequality sin A sin B le sin^2 frac{C}{2}. CommentAlternative formulation, from IMO ShortList 1974, Finland 2: We consider a triangle ABC. Prove that: sin(A) sin(B) leq sin^2 left( frac{C}{2} right) is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a point D on the segment AB so that CD is the geometrical mean of AD and BD.
