Let ABC be a triangle with circumcircle omega, circumcenter O{}, and orthocenter H{}. Let K{} be the midpoint of AH{}. The perpendicular to OK{} at K{} intersects AB{} and AC{} at P{} and Q{}, respectively. The lines BK and CK intersect omega again at X{} and Y{}, respectively. Prove that the second intersection of the circumcircles of triangles KPY and KQX lies on omega. Stefan Lozanovski
