Let triangle ABC be an acute-angled triangle with AB not= AC. Let H be the orthocenter of triangle ABC, and let M be the midpoint of the side BC. Let D be a point on the side AB and E a point on the side AC such that AE=AD and the points D, H, E are on the same line. Prove that the line HM is perpendicular to the common chord of the circumscribed circles of triangle triangle ABC and triangle triangle ADE.
