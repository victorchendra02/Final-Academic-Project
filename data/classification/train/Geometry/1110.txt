Given a triangle ABC. The points A, B, C divide the circumcircle Omega of the triangle ABC into three arcs BC, CA, AB. Let X be a variable point on the arc AB, and let O_{1} and O_{2} be the incenters of the triangles CAX and CBX. Prove that the circumcircle of the triangle XO_{1}O_{2} intersects the circle Omega in a fixed point.
