Let ABC be a scalene and acute triangle with circumcenter O. Let omega be the circle with center A, tangent to BC at D. Suppose there are two points F and G on omega such that FG perp AO, angle BFD = angle DGC and the couples of points (B,F) and (C,G) are in different halfplanes with respect to the line AD. Show that the tangents to omega at F and G meet on the circumcircle of ABC.
