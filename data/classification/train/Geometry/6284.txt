Let Gamma and Gamma' be two circles with centres O and O', such that O belongs to Gamma'. Let M be a point on Gamma', outside of Gamma. The tangents to Gamma that go through M touch Gamma in two points A and B, and cross Gamma' again in two points C and D. Finally, let E be the crossing point of the lines AB and CD. Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles CEO' and DEO' are tangent to Gamma'.
