Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle. Let L be any line in the plane of the triangle ABC. Denote by u, v, w the lengths of the perpendiculars to L from A, B, C respectively. Prove the inequality u^2 cdot tan A + v^2 cdot tan B + w^2 cdot tan C geq 2 cdot S, where S is the area of the triangle ABC. Determine the lines L for which equality holds.
