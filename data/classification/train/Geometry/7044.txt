I, Omega are the incenter and the circumcircle of triangle ABC, respectively, and the tangents of B,C to Omega intersect at L. Assume that P neq C is a point on Omega such that CI,AP, and the circle with center L and radius LC are concurrent. Let the foot from I to AB be F, the midpoint of BC be M, X is a point on Omega s.t. AI,BC,PX are concurrent. Prove that the lines AI,AX,MF form an isosceles triangle. Proposed by ckliao914
