As shown below, there is a 40 times30 paper with a filled 10 times5 rectangle inside of it. We want to cut out the filled rectangle from the paper using four straight cuts. Each straight cut is a straight line that divides the paper into two pieces, and we keep the piece containing the filled rectangle. The goal is to minimize the total length of the straight cuts. How to achieve this goal, and what is that minimized length? Show the correct cuts and write the final answer. There is no need to prove the answer. Proposed by Morteza Saghafian
