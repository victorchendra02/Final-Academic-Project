Let ABCDE be a convex pentagon such that BC=DE. Assume that there is a point T inside ABCDE with TB=TD,TC=TE and angle ABT = angle TEA. Let line AB intersect lines CD and CT at points P and Q, respectively. Assume that the points P,B,A,Q occur on their line in that order. Let line AE intersect CD and DT at points R and S, respectively. Assume that the points R,E,A,S occur on their line in that order. Prove that the points P,S,Q,R lie on a circle.
