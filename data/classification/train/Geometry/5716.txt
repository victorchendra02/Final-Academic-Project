Let ABC be an acute triangle with circumcenter O and orthocenter H. The circle with center X_A passes through the points A and H and is tangent to the circumcircle of the triangle ABC. Similarly, define the points X_B and X_C. Let O_A, O_B and O_C be the reflections of O with respect to sides BC, CA and AB, respectively. Prove that the lines O_AX_A, O_BX_B and O_CX_C are concurrent.
