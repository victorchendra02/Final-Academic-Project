C and D are points on a semicircle. The tangent at C meets the extended diameter of the semicircle at B, and the tangent at D meets it at A, so that A and B are on opposite sides of the center. The lines AC and BD meet at E. F is the foot of the perpendicular from E to AB. Show that EF bisects angle CFD
