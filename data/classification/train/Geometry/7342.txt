Let triangle ABC be a right-angled triangle with angle BAC = 90^{ circ}, and let E be the foot of the perpendicular from A to BC. Let Z neq A be a point on the line AB with AB = BZ. Let (c) and (c_1) be the circumcircles of the triangles triangle AEZ and triangle BEZ, respectively. Let (c_2) be an arbitrary circle passing through the points A and E. Suppose (c_1) meets the line CZ again at the point F, and meets (c_2) again at the point N. If P is the other point of intersection of (c_2) with AF, prove that the points N, B, P are collinear.
