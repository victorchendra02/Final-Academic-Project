S_1 and S_2 are two circles that intersect at two different points P and Q. Let ell_1 and ell_2 be two parallel lines such that ell_1 passes through the point P and intersects S_1,S_2 at A_1,A_2 respectively (both distinct from P), and ell_2 passes through the point Q and intersects S_1,S_2 at B_1,B_2 respectively (both distinct from Q). Show that the triangles A_1QA_2 and B_1PB_2 have the same perimeter.
