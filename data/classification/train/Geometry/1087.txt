The tangents at B and A to the circumcircle of an acute angled triangle ABC meet the tangent at C at T and U respectively. AT meets BC at P, and Q is the midpoint of AP; BU meets CA at R, and S is the midpoint of BR. Prove that angle ABQ= angle BAS. Determine, in terms of ratios of side lengths, the triangles for which this angle is a maximum.
