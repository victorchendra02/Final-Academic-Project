Let Gamma be a circle with centre I, and A B C D a convex quadrilateral such that each of the segments A B, B C, C D and D A is tangent to Gamma. Let Omega be the circumcircle of the triangle A I C. The extension of B A beyond A meets Omega at X, and the extension of B C beyond C meets Omega at Z. The extensions of A D and C D beyond D meet Omega at Y and T, respectively. Prove that A D+D T+T X+X A=C D+D Y+Y Z+Z C. Proposed by Dominik Burek, Poland and Tomasz Ciesla, Poland
