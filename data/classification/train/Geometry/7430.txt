Let {AB} be a chord of a circle {(c)} centered at {O}, and let {K} be a point on the segment {AB} such that {AK<BK}. Two circles through {K}, internally tangent to {(c)} at {A} and {B}, respectively, meet again at {L}. Let {P} be one of the points of intersection of the line {KL} and the circle {(c)}, and let the lines {AB} and {LO} meet at {M}. Prove that the line {MP} is tangent to the circle {(c)}.
