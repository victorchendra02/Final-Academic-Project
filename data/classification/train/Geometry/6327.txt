a) Let UVW , U'V'W' be two triangles such that VW = V'W' , UV = U'V' , angle WUV = angle W'U'V'. Prove that the angles angle VWU , angle V'W'U' are equal or supplementary. b) ABC is a triangle where angle A is obtuse. take a point P inside the triangle , and extend AP,BP,CP to meet the sides BC,CA,AB in K,L,M respectively. Suppose that PL = PM . 1) If AP bisects angle A , then prove that AB = AC . 2) Find the angles of the triangle ABC if you know that AK,BL,CM are angle bisectors of the triangle ABC and that 2AK = BL.
