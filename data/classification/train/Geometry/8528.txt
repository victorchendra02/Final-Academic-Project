Let ABCD be a parallelogram with angle DAB < 90 Let E be the point on the line BC such that AE = AB and let F be the point on the line CD such that AF = AD. The circumcircle of the triangle CEF intersects the line AE again in P and the line AF again in Q. Let X be the reflection of P over the line DE and Y the reflection of Q over the line BF. Prove that A, X, Y lie on the same line.
