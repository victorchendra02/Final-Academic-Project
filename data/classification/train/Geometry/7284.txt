Let the circles omega and omega' intersect in points A and B. The tangent to circle omega at A intersects omega' at C and the tangent to circle omega' at A intersects omega at D. Suppose that the internal bisector of angle CAD intersects omega and omega' at E and F, respectively, and the external bisector of angle CAD intersects omega and omega' at X and Y, respectively. Prove that the perpendicular bisector of XY is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle BEF. Proposed by Mahdi Etesami Fard
