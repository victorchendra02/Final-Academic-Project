In the acute-angled triangle ABC, the point F is the foot of the altitude from A, and P is a point on the segment AF. The lines through P parallel to AC and AB meet BC at D and E, respectively. Points X ne A and Y ne A lie on the circles ABD and ACE, respectively, such that DA = DX and EA = EY. Prove that B, C, X, and Y are concyclic.
