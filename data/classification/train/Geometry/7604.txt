Let Gamma be a circle of center O, and delta. be a line in the plane of Gamma, not intersecting it. Denote by A the foot of the perpendicular from O onto delta., and let M be a (variable) point on Gamma. Denote by gamma the circle of diameter AM , by X the (other than M ) intersection point of gamma and Gamma, and by Y the (other than A) intersection point of gamma and delta. Prove that the line XY passes through a fixed point.
