Let ABC be a triangle with angle ABC neq 90^ circ, and AB its shortest side. Let H be the orthocenter of ABC. Let Gamma be the circle with center B and radius BA. Let D be the second point where the line CA meets Gamma. Let E be the second point where Gamma meets the circumcircle of the triangle BCD. Let F be the intersection point of the lines DE and BH. Prove that the line BD is tangent to the circumcircle of the triangle DFH.
