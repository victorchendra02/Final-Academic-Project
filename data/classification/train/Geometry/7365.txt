Let ABC be a triangle with circumcircle omega. Let l_B and l_C be two lines through the points B and C, respectively, such that l_B parallel l_C. The second intersections of l_B and l_C with omega are D and E, respectively. Assume that D and E are on the same side of BC as A. Let DA intersect l_C at F and let EA intersect l_B at G. If O, O_1 and O_2 are circumcenters of the triangles ABC, ADG and AEF, respectively, and P is the circumcenter of the triangle OO_1O_2, prove that l_B parallel OP parallel l_C.
