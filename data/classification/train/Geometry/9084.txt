Let ABC be a triangle with incenter I . The circle of center I which passes through B intersects AC at points E and F, with E and F between A and C and different from each other. The circle circumscribed to triangle IEF intersects segments EB and FB at Q and R, respectively. Line QR intersects the sides A B and B C at P and S, respectively. If a , b and c are the measures of the sides B C, CA and A B, respectively, calculate the measurements of B P and B S.
