Let A_1A_2A_3 ldots A_n be a regular n-gon. Let B_1 and B_{n-1} be the midpoints of its sides A_1A_2 and A_{n-1}A_n. Also, for every i in left {2,3,4, ldots ,n-2 right }. Let S be the point of intersection of the lines A_1A_{i+1} and A_nA_i, and let B_i be the point of intersection of the angle bisector bisector of the angle measuredangle A_iSA_{i+1} with the segment A_iA_{i+1}. Prove that sum_{i=1}^{n-1} measuredangle A_1B_iA_n=180^{ circ}. Proposed by Dusan Dukic, Serbia and Montenegro
