Circle with center I, inscribed in a triangle ABC , touches the sides BC and AC at points A_1 and B_1 respectively. On rays A_1I and B_1I, respectively, let be the points A_2 and B_2 such that IA_2=IB_2=R, where Ris the radius of the circumscribed circle of the triangle ABC. Prove that: a) AA_2 = BB_2 = OI where O is the center of the circumscribed circle of the triangle ABC, b) lines AA_2 and BB_2 intersect on the circumcircle of the triangle ABC.
