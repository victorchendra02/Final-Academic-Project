Let two circles C_1 and C_2 intersect in points A and B. The tangent to C_1 at A intersects C_2 in P and the line PB intersects C_1 for the second time in Q (suppose that Q is outside C_2). The tangent to C_2 from Q intersects C_1 and C_2 in C and D, respectively. (The points A and D lie on different sides of the line PQ.) Show that AD is the bisector of angle CAP.
