Let ABC be an acute scalene triangle, and let A_1, B_1, C_1 be the feet of the altitudes from A, B, C. Let A_2 be the intersection of the tangents to the circle ABC at B, C and define B_2, C_2 similarly. Let A_2A_1 intersect the circle A_2B_2C_2 again at A_3 and define B_3, C_3 similarly. Show that the circles AA_1A_3, BB_1B_3, and CC_1C_3 all have two common points, X_1 and X_2 which both lie on the Euler line of the triangle ABC. United Kingdom, Joe Benton
