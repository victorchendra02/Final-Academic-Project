Let ABC be a triangle with AB < AC and let D{} be the other intersection point of the angle bisector of angle A with the circumcircle of the triangle ABC. Let E{} and F{} be points on the sides AB and AC respectively, such that AE = AF and let P{} be the point of intersection of AD and EF. Let M{} be the midpoint of BC{}. Prove that AM and the circumcircles of the triangles AEF and PMD pass through a common point.
