Given an acute triangle {ABC}, erect triangles {ABD} and {ACE} externally, so that { angle ADB= angle AEC=90^o} and { angle BAD= angle CAE}. Let {{A}_{1}} in BC,{{B}_{1}} in AC and {{C}_{1}} in AB be the feet of the altitudes of the triangle {ABC}, and let K and {K,L} be the midpoints of [ B{{C}_{1}} ] and {BC_1, CB_1}, respectively. Prove that the circumcenters of the triangles AKL,{{A}_{1}}{{B}_{1}}{{C}_{1}} and {DEA_1} are collinear. (Bulgaria)
