On the circle k, the points A,B are given, while AB is not the diameter of the circle k. Point C moves along the long arc AB of circle k so that the triangle ABC is acute. Let D,E be the feet of the altitudes from A, B respectively. Let F be the projection of point D on line AC and G be the projection of point E on line BC. (a) Prove that the lines AB and FG are parallel. (b) Determine the set of midpoints S of segment FG while along all allowable positions of point C.
