Consider an acute-angled triangle triangle ABC (AC>AB) with its orthocenter H and circumcircle Gamma.Points M,P are midpoints of BC and AH respectively.The line overline{AM} meets Gamma again at X and point N lies on the line overline{BC} so that overline{NX} is tangent to Gamma. Points J and K lie on the circle with diameter MP such that angle AJP= angle HNM (B and J lie one the same side of overline{AH}) and circle omega_1, passing through K,H, and J, and circle omega_2 passing through K,M, and N, are externally tangent to each other. Prove that the common external tangents of omega_1 and omega_2 meet on the line overline{NH}. Proposed by Alireza Dadgarnia
