Let triangle ABC be an acute triangle. The line through A perpendicular to BC intersects BC at D. Let E be the midpoint of AD and omega the the circle with center E and radius equal to AE. The line BE intersects omega at a point X such that X and B are not on the same side of AD and the line CE intersects omega at a point Y such that C and Y are not on the same side of AD. If both of the intersection points of the circumcircles of triangle BDX and triangle CDY lie on the line AD, prove that AB = AC.
