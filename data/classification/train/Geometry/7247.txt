Convex hexagon A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5A_6 lies in the interior of convex hexagon B_1B_2B_3B_4B_5B_6 such that A_1A_2 parallel B_1B_2, A_2A_3 parallel B_2B_3,..., A_6A_1 parallel B_6B_1. Prove that the areas of simple hexagons A_1B_2A_3B_4A_5B_6 and B_1A_2B_3A_4B_5A_6 are equal. (A simple hexagon is a hexagon which does not intersect itself.)
