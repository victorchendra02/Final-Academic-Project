In an acute triangle ABC, let D, E, F be the feet of the perpendiculars from the points A, B, C to the lines BC, CA, AB, respectively, and let P, Q, R be the feet of the perpendiculars from the points A, B, C to the lines EF, FD, DE, respectively. Prove that p left(ABC right)p left(PQR right) ge left(p left(DEF right) right)^{2}, where p left(T right) denotes the perimeter of triangle T . Proposed by Hojoo Lee, Korea
