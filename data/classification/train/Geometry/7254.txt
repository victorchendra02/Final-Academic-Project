We have a polyhedron all faces of which are triangle. Let P be an arbitrary point on one of the edges of this polyhedron such that P is not the midpoint or endpoint of this edge. Assume that P_0 = P. In each step, connect P_i to the centroid of one of the faces containing it. This line meets the perimeter of this face again at point P_{i+1}. Continue this process with P_{i+1} and the other face containing P_{i+1}. Prove that by continuing this process, we cannot pass through all the faces. (The centroid of a triangle is the point of intersection of its medians.) Proposed by Mahdi Etesamifard - Morteza Saghafian
