Let ABC be a triangle and ell_1, ell_2 be two parallel lines. Let ell_i intersects line BC,CA,AB at X_i,Y_i,Z_i, respectively. Let Delta_i be the triangle formed by the line passed through X_i and perpendicular to BC, the line passed through Y_i and perpendicular to CA, and the line passed through Z_i and perpendicular to AB. Prove that the circumcircles of Delta_1 and Delta_2 are tangent.
