Let ABC be a scalene acute-angled triangle with its incenter I and circumcircle Gamma. Line AI intersects Gamma for the second time at M. Let N be the midpoint of BC and T be the point on Gamma such that IN perp MT. Finally, let P and Q be the intersection points of TB and TC, respectively, with the line perpendicular to AI at I. Show that PB = CQ. Proposed by Patrik Bak - Slovakia
