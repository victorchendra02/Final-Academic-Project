As shown in the following figure, a heart is a shape consist of three semicircles with diameters AB, BC and AC such that B is midpoint of the segment AC. A heart omega is given. Call a pair (P, P') bisector if P and P' lie on omega and bisect its perimeter. Let (P, P') and (Q,Q') be bisector pairs. Tangents at points P, P', Q, and Q' to omega construct a convex quadrilateral XYZT. If the quadrilateral XYZT is inscribed in a circle, find the angle between lines PP' and QQ'. https://cdn.artofproblemsolving.com/attachments/3/c/8216889594bbb504372d8cddfac73b9f56e74c.png Proposed by Mahdi Etesamifard - Iran
