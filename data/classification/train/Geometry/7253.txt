Let omega_1, omega_2 be two circles with centers O_1 and O_2, respectively. These two circles intersect each other at points A and B. Line O_1B intersects omega_2 for the second time at point C, and line O_2A intersects omega_1 for the second time at point D . Let X be the second intersection of AC and omega_1. Also Y is the second intersection point of BD and omega_2. Prove that CX = DY . Proposed by Alireza Dadgarnia
