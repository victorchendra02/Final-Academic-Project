Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with angle BAC = 90^{ circ}. Let the height from A cut its side BC at D. Let I, I_B, I_C be the incenters of triangles ABC, ABD, ACD respectively. Let also EB, EC be the excenters of ABC with respect to vertices B and C respectively. If K is the point of intersection of the circumcircles of E_CIB_I and E_BIC_I, show that KI passes through the midpoint M of side BC.
