Let ABC be a non-isosceles triangle with incenter I. Let D be a point on the segment BC such that the circumcircle of BID intersects the segment AB at E neq B, and the circumcircle of CID intersects the segment AC at F neq C. The circumcircle of DEF intersects AB and AC at the second points M and N respectively. Let P be the point of intersection of IB and DE, and let Q be the point of intersection of IC and DF. Prove that the three lines EN, FM and PQ are parallel. Proposed by Saudi Arabia
