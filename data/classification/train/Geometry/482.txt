Let ABC be a triangle with circumcircle omega and let Omega_A be the A-excircle. Let X and Y be the intersection points of omega and Omega_A. Let P and Q be the projections of A onto the tangent lines to Omega_A at X and Y respectively. The tangent line at P to the circumcircle of the triangle APX intersects the tangent line at Q to the circumcircle of the triangle AQY at a point R. Prove that overline{AR} perp overline{BC}.
