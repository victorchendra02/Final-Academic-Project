Let {ABC} be an acute angled triangle, let {O} be its circumcentre, and let {D,E,F} be points on the sides {BC,CA,AB}, respectively. The circle {(c_1)} of radius {FA}, centered at {F}, crosses the segment {OA} at {A'} and the circumcircle {(c)} of the triangle {ABC}again at {K}. Similarly, the circle {(c_2)} of radius DB, centered at D, crosses the segment left( OB right) at {B}' and the circle {(c)} again at {L}. Finally, the circle {(c_3)} of radius EC, centered at E, crosses the segment left( OC right)at {C}' and the circle {(c)} again at {M}. Prove that the quadrilaterals BKF{A}',CLD{B}' and AME{C}' are all cyclic, and their circumcircles share a common point. Evangelos Psychas (Greece)
