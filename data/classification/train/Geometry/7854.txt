Triangle ABC has incenter I and excircles Omega_A, Omega_B, and Omega_C. Let ell_A be the line through the feet of the tangents from I to Omega_A, and define lines ell_B and ell_C similarly. Prove that the orthocenter of the triangle formed by lines ell_A, ell_B, and ell_C coincides with the Nagel point of triangle ABC. (The Nagel point of triangle ABC is the intersection of segments AT_A, BT_B, and CT_C, where T_A is the tangency point of Omega_A with side BC, and points T_B and T_C are defined similarly.)
