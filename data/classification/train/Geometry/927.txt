Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral. A circle passing through the points A and D and a circle passing through the points B and C are externally tangent at a point P inside the quadrilateral. Suppose that angle{PAB}+ angle{PDC} leq 90^ circ qquad text{and} qquad angle{PBA}+ angle{PCD} leq 90^ circ. Prove that AB+CD geq BC+AD. Proposed by Waldemar Pompe, Poland
