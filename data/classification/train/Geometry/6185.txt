Let ABC be a triangle and let D, E and F be the midpoints of sides BC, CA and AB, respectively. Let X ne A be the intersection of AD with the circumcircle of ABC. Let Omega be the circle through D and X, tangent to the circumcircle of ABC. Let Y and Z be the intersections of the tangent to Omega at D with the perpendicular bisectors of segments DE and DF, respectively. Let P be the intersection of YE and ZF and let G be the centroid of ABC. Show that the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle of ABC and the line PG are concurrent.
