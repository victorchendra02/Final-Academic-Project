(i) ABC is a triangle with a right angle at A, and P is a point on the hypotenuse BC. The line AP produced beyond P meets the line through B which is perpendicular to BC at U. Prove that BU = BA if, and only if, CP = CA. (ii) A is a point on the semicircle CB, and points X and Y are on the line segment BC. The line AX, produced beyond X, meets the line through B which is perpendicular to BC at U. Also the line AY, produced beyond Y, meets the line through C which is perpendicular to BC at V. Given that BY = BA and CX = CA, determine the angle angle VAU.
