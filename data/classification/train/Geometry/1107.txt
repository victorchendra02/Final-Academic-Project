Let ABC be a triangle, Omega its incircle and Omega_{a}, Omega_{b}, Omega_{c} three circles orthogonal to Omega passing through (B,C),(A,C) and (A,B) respectively. The circles Omega_{a} and Omega_{b} meet again in C'; in the same way we obtain the points B' and A'. Prove that the radius of the circumcircle of A'B'C' is half the radius of Omega.
