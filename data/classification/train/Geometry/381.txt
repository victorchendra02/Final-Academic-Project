Let ABC be a triangle, and let P, Q, R be three points in the interiors of the sides BC, CA, AB of this triangle. Prove that the area of at least one of the three triangles AQR, BRP, CPQ is less than or equal to one quarter of the area of triangle ABC. Alternative formulation: Let ABC be a triangle, and let P, Q, R be three points on the segments BC, CA, AB, respectively. Prove that min left { left|AQR right|, left|BRP right|, left|CPQ right| right } leq frac14 cdot left|ABC right|, where the abbreviation left|P_1P_2P_3 right| denotes the (non-directed) area of an arbitrary triangle P_1P_2P_3.
