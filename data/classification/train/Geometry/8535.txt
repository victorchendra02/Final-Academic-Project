Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral such that AC = BD and the sides AB and CD are not parallel. Let P be the intersection point of the diagonals AC and BD. Points E and F lie, respectively, on segments BP and AP such that PC=PE and PD=PF. Prove that the circumcircle of the triangle determined by the lines AB, CD, EF is tangent to the circumcircle of the triangle ABP.
