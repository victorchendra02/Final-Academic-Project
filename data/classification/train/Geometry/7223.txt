In acute-angled triangle ABC (AC > AB), point H is the orthocenter and point M is the midpoint of the segment BC. The median AM intersects the circumcircle of triangle ABC at X. The line CH intersects the perpendicular bisector of BC at E and the circumcircle of the triangle ABC again at F. Point J lies on circle omega, passing through X, E, and F, such that BCHJ is a trapezoid (CB parallel HJ). Prove that JB and EM meet on omega. Proposed by Alireza Dadgarnia
