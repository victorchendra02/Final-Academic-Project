Square ABCD and circle O intersect in eight points, forming four curvilinear triangles, AEF , BGH , CIJ and DKL (EF , GH, IJ and KL are arcs of the circle) . Prove that (a) The sum of lengths of EF and IJ equals the sum of the lengths of GH and KL. (b) The sum of the perimeters of curvilinear triangles AEF and CIJ equals the sum of the perimeters of the curvilinear triangles BGH and DKL. ( V . V . Proizvolov , Moscow)
