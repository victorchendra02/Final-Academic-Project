Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle with AC > BC, with incircle tau centered at I which touches BC and AC at points D and E, respectively. The point M on tau is such that BM parallel DE and M and B lie on the same halfplane with respect to the angle bisector of angle ACB. Let F and H be the intersections of tau with BM and CM different from M, respectively. Let J be a point on the line AC such that JM parallel EH. Let K be the intersection of JF and tau different from F. Prove that ME parallel KH.
