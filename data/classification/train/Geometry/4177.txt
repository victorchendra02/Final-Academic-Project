Let ABC be a triangle with AB < AC < BC. On the side BC we consider points D and E such that BA = BD and CE = CA. Let K be the circumcenter of triangle ADE and let F, G be the points of intersection of the lines AD, KC and AE, KB respectively. Let omega_1 be the circumcircle of triangle KDE, omega_2 the circle with center F and radius FE, and omega_3 the circle with center G and radius GD. Prove that omega_1, omega_2, and omega_3 pass through the same point and that this point of intersection lies on the line AK.
