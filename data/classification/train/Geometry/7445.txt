Let ABC be an acute triangle with {AB neq AC}. The incircle { omega} of the triangle touches the sides {BC, CA} and {AB} at {D, E} and {F}, respectively. The perpendicular line erected at {C} onto {BC} meets {EF} at {M}, and similarly the perpendicular line erected at {B} onto {BC} meets {EF} at {N}. The line {DM} meets { omega} again in {P}, and the line {DN} meets { omega} again at {Q}. Prove that {DP=DQ}. Ruben Dario & Leo Giugiuc (Romania)
