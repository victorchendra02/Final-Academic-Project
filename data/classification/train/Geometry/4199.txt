Let MAZN be an isosceles trapezium inscribed in a circle (c) with centre O. Assume that MN is a diameter of (c) and let B be the midpoint of AZ. Let ( epsilon) be the perpendicular line on AZ passing through A. Let C be a point on ( epsilon), let E be the point of intersection of CB with (c) and assume that AE is perpendicular to CB. Let D be the point of intersection of CZ with (c) and let F be the antidiametric point of D on (c). Let P be the point of intersection of FE and CZ. Assume that the tangents of (c) at the points M and Z meet the lines AZ and PA at the points K and T respectively. Prove that OK is perpendicular to TM. Theoklitos Parayiou, Cyprus
