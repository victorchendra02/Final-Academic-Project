Let omega be the circumcircle of right-angled triangle ABC ( angle A = 90^{ circ}). The tangent to omega at point A intersects the line BC at point P. Suppose that M is the midpoint of the minor arc AB, and PM intersects omega for the second time in Q. The tangent to omega at point Q intersects AC at K. Prove that angle PKC = 90^{ circ}.
