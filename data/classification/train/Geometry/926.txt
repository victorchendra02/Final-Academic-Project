In a triangle ABC, let M_{a}, M_{b}, M_{c} be the midpoints of the sides BC, CA, AB, respectively, and T_{a}, T_{b}, T_{c} be the midpoints of the arcs BC, CA, AB of the circumcircle of ABC, not containing the vertices A, B, C, respectively. For i in left {a, b, c right }, let w_{i} be the circle with M_{i}T_{i} as diameter. Let p_{i} be the common external common tangent to the circles w_{j} and w_{k} (for all left {i, j, k right }= left {a, b, c right }) such that w_{i} lies on the opposite side of p_{i} than w_{j} and w_{k} do. Prove that the lines p_{a}, p_{b}, p_{c} form a triangle similar to ABC and find the ratio of similitude. Proposed by Tomas Jurik, Slovakia
