Let ABC be an equiangular triangle with circumcircle omega. Let point F in AB and point E in AC so that angle ABE+ angle ACF=60^{ circ}. The circumcircle of triangle AFE intersects the circle omega in the point D. The halflines DE and DF intersect the line through B and C in the points X and Y. Prove that the incenter of the triangle DXY is independent of the choice of E and F. (The angles in the problem statement are not directed. It is assumed that E and F are chosen in such a way that the halflines DE and DF indeed intersect the line through B and C.)
