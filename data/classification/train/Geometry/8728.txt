Let M and N be the midpoints of the sides AC and AB, respectively, of an acute triangle ABC, AB neq AC. Let omega_B be the circle centered at M passing through B, and let omega_C be the circle centered at N passing through C. Let the point D be such that ABCD is an isosceles trapezoid with AD parallel to BC. Assume that omega_B and omega_C intersect in two distinct points P and Q. Show that D lies on the line PQ.
