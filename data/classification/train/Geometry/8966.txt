Let ABC be an equilateral triangle and let P_0 be a point outside this triangle, such that triangle{AP_0C} is an isoscele triangle with a right angle at P_0. A grasshopper starts from P_0 and turns around the triangle as follows. From P_0 the grasshopper jumps to P_1, which is the symmetric point of P_0 with respect to A. From P_1, the grasshopper jumps to P_2, which is the symmetric point of P_1 with respect to B. Then the grasshopper jumps to P_3 which is the symmetric point of P_2 with respect to C, and so on. Compare the distance P_0P_1 and P_0P_n. n in N.
