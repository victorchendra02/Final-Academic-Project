Let S be a convex quadrilateral ABCD and O a point inside it. The feet of the perpendiculars from O to AB, BC, CD, DA are A_1, B_1, C_1, D_1 respectively. The feet of the perpendiculars from O to the sides of S_i, the quadrilateral A_iB_iC_iD_i, are A_{i+1}B_{i+1}C_{i+1}D_{i+1}, where i = 1, 2, 3. Prove that S_4 is similar to S.
