Consider a 100 times 100 square unit lattice textbf{L} (hence textbf{L} has 10000 points). Suppose mathcal{F} is a set of polygons such that all vertices of polygons in mathcal{F} lie in textbf{L} and every point in textbf{L} is the vertex of exactly one polygon in mathcal{F}. Find the maximum possible sum of the areas of the polygons in mathcal{F}. Michael Ren and Ankan Bhattacharya, USA
