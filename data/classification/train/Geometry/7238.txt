Three circles omega_1, omega_2 and omega_3 pass through one common point, say P. The tangent line to omega_1 at P intersects omega_2 and omega_3 for the second time at points P_{1,2} and P_{1,3}, respectively. Points P_{2,1}, P_{2,3}, P_{3,1} and P_{3,2} are similarly defined. Prove that the perpendicular bisector of segments P_{1,2}P_{1,3}, P_{2,1}P_{2,3} and P_{3,1}P_{3,2} are concurrent. Proposed by Mahdi Etesamifard
