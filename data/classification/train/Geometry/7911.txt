Let omega denote the incircle of triangle ABC, which is tangent to side BC at point D. Let G denote the second intersection of line AD and circle omega. The tangent to omega at point G intersects sides AB and AC at points E and F respectively. The circumscribed circle of DEF intersects omega at points D and M. The circumscribed circle of BCG intersects omega at points G and N. Prove that lines AD and MN are parallel. Proposed by Agoston Gyorffy, Remeteszolos
