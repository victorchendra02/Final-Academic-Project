Given the tetrahedron ABCD whose edges AB and CD have lengths a and b respectively. The distance between the skew lines AB and CD is d, and the angle between them is omega. Tetrahedron ABCD is divided into two solids by plane epsilon, parallel to lines AB and CD. The ratio of the distances of epsilon from AB and CD is equal to k. Compute the ratio of the volumes of the two solids obtained.
