(a) Given a tetrahedron ABCD and its four altitudes (i.e., lines through each vertex, perpendicular to the opposite face), assume that the altitude dropped from D passes through the orthocenter H_4 of triangle ABC. Prove that this altitude DH_4 intersects all the other three altitudes. (b) If we further know that a second altitude, say the one from vertex A to the face BCD, also passes through the orthocenter H_1 of triangle BCD, then prove that all four altitudes are concurrent and each one passes through the orthocenter of the respective triangle.
