Let ABC be a triangle inscribed in circle C. Circles C_1, C_2, C_3 are tangent internally with circle C in A_1, B_1, C_1 and tangent to sides [BC], [CA], [AB] in points A_2, B_2, C_2 respectively, so that A, A_1 are on one side of BC and so on. Lines A_1A_2, B_1B_2 and C_1C_2 intersect the circle C for second time at points A,B and C, respectively. If M = BB cap CC, prove that m ( angle MAA) = 90^ circ .
