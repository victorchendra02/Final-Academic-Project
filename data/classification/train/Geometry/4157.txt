Let ABC a triangle and let omega be its circumcircle. Let E{} be the midpoint of the minor arc BC of omega, and M{} the midpoint of BC. Let V be the other point of intersection of AM with omega, F{} the point of intersection of AE with BC, X{} the other point of intersection of the circumcircle of FEM with omega, X' the reflection of V{} with respect to M{}, A'{} the foot of the perpendicular from A{} to BC and S{} the other point of intersection of XA' with omega. If Z in omega with Z neq X is such that AX = AZ, then prove that S, X' and Z{} are collinear.
