A circle omega with radius 1 is given. A collection T of triangles is called good, if the following conditions hold: each triangle from T is inscribed in omega; no two triangles from T have a common interior point. Determine all positive real numbers t such that, for each positive integer n, there exists a good collection of n triangles, each of perimeter greater than t.
