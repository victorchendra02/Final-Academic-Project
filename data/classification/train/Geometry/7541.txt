Let ABC be a triangle in which ({BL}is the angle bisector of { angle{ABC}} left( L in AC right), {AH} is an altitude of vartriangle ABC left( H in BC right) and {M}is the midpoint of the side {AB}. It is known that the midpoints of the segments {BL} and {MH} coincides. Determine the internal angles of triangle vartriangle ABC.
