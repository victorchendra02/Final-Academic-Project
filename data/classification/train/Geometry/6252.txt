Let ABC be a triangle and Q a point on the internal angle bisector of angle BAC . Circle omega_1 is circumscribed to triangle BAQ and intersects the segment AC in point P neq C. Circle omega_2 is circumscribed to the triangle CQP. Radius of the cirlce omega_1 is larger than the radius of omega_2. Circle centered at Q with radius QA intersects the circle omega_1 in points A and A_1. Circle centered at Q with radius QC intersects omega_1 in points C_1 and C_2. Prove angle A_1BC_1 = angle C_2PA . Proposed by Matija Bucic.
