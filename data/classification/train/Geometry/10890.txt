The circle with the center of O touches the sides of the angle A at the points of K and M . The tangent to the circle intersects the segments AK and AM at points B and C respectively, and the line KM intersects the segments OB and OC at the points D and E . Prove that the area of the triangle ODE is equal to a quarter of the area of a triangle BOC if and only if the angle A is 60^ circ .
