Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral. The perpendicular bisectors of its sides AB and CD meet at Y. Denote by X a point inside the quadrilateral ABCD such that measuredangle ADX = measuredangle BCX < 90^{ circ} and measuredangle DAX = measuredangle CBX < 90^{ circ}. Show that measuredangle AYB = 2 cdot measuredangle ADX.
