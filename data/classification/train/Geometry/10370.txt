On the sides of triangle ABC, three similar triangles are constructed with triangle YBA and triangle ZAC in the exterior and triangle XBC in the interior. (Above, the vertices of the triangles are ordered so that the similarities take vertices to corresponding vertices, for example, the similarity between triangle YBA and triangle ZAC takes Y to Z, B to A and A to C). Prove that AYXZ is a parallelogram
