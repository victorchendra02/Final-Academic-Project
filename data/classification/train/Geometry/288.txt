Three points A,B,C are such that B in AC. On one side of AC, draw the three semicircles with diameters AB,BC,CA. The common interior tangent at B to the first two semicircles meets the third circle E. Let U,V be the points of contact of the common exterior tangent to the first two semicircles. Evaluate the ratio R= frac{[EUV]}{[EAC]} as a function of r_{1} = frac{AB}{2} and r_2 = frac{BC}{2}, where [X] denotes the area of polygon X.
