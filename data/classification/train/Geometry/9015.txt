Let ABC be a triangle with AB<AC and circuncircle omega. Let M and N be the midpoints of AC and AB respectively and G is the centroid of ABC. Let P be the foot of perpendicular of A to the line BC, and the point Q is the intersection of GP and omega(Q,P,G are collinears in this order). The line QM cuts omega in M_1 and the line QN cuts omega in N_1. If K is the intersection of BM_1 and CN_1 prove that P, G and K are collinears.
