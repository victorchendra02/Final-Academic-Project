The altitudes through the vertices A,B,C of an acute-angled triangle ABC meet the opposite sides at D,E,F, respectively. The line through D parallel to EF meets the lines AC and AB at Q and R, respectively. The line EF meets BC at P. Prove that the circumcircle of the triangle PQR passes through the midpoint of BC.
