Let C_1 and C_2 be two different circles , and let their radii be r_1 and r_2 , the two circles are passing through the two points A and B (i)Let P_1 on C_1 and P_2 on C_2 such that the line P_1P_2 passes through A. Prove that P_1B cdot r_2 = P_2B cdot r_1 (ii)Let DEF be a triangle that it's inscribed in C_1 , and let D'E'F' be a triangle that is inscribed in C_2 . The lines EE',DD' and FF' all pass through A . Prove that the triangles DEF and D'E'F' are similar (iii)The circle C_3 also passes through A and B . Let l be a line that passes through A and cuts circles C_i in M_i with i = 1,2,3 . Prove that the value of frac{M_1M_2}{M_1M_3}is constant regardless of the position of l Provided that l is different from AB
