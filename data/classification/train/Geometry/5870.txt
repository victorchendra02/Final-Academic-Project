Let { omega} be the circumcircle of an acute-angled triangle {ABC}. Point {D} lies on the arc {BC} of { omega} not containing point {A}. Point {E} lies in the interior of the triangle {ABC}, does not lie on the line {AD}, and satisfies { angle DBE = angle ACB} and { angle DCE = angle ABC}. Let {F} be a point on the line {AD} such that lines {EF} and {BC} are parallel, and let {G} be a point on { omega} different from {A} such that {AF = FG}. Prove that points {D,E, F,G} lie on one circle. (Slovakia)
