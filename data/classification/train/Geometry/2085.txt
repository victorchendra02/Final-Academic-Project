In a triangle, a symmedian is a line through a vertex that is symmetric to the median with the respect to the internal bisector (all relative to the same vertex). In the triangle ABC, the median m_a meets BC at A' and the circumcircle again at A_1. The symmedian s_a meets BC at M and the circumcircle again at A_2. Given that the line A_1A_2 contains the circumcenter O of the triangle, prove that: (a) frac{AA'}{AM} = frac{b^2+c^2}{2bc} ; (b) 1+4b^2c^2 = a^2(b^2+c^2)
