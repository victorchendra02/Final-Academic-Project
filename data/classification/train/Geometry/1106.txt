For a triangle T = ABC we take the point X on the side (AB) such that AX/AB=4/5, the point Y on the segment (CX) such that CY = 2YX and, if possible, the point Z on the ray (CA such that widehat{CXZ} = 180 - widehat{ABC}. We denote by Sigma the set of all triangles T for which widehat{XYZ} = 45. Prove that all triangles from Sigma are similar and find the measure of their smallest angle.
