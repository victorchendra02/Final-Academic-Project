Let H be the orthocentre of an acute triangle ABC with BC > AC, inscribed in a circle Gamma. The circle with centre C and radius CB intersects Gamma at the point D, which is on the arc AB not containing C. The circle with centre C and radius CA intersects the segment CD at the point K. The line parallel to BD through K, intersects AB at point L. If M is the midpoint of AB and N is the foot of the perpendicular from H to CL, prove that the line MN bisects the segment CH.
