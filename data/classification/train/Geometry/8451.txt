Let ABC be a triangle. Let D be the intersection point of the angle bisector at A with BC. Let T be the intersection point of the tangent line to the circumcircle of triangle ABC at point A with the line through B and C. Let I be the intersection point of the orthogonal line to AT through point D with the altitude h_a of the triangle at point A. Let P be the midpoint of AB, and let O be the circumcenter of triangle ABC. Let M be the intersection point of AB and TI, and let F be the intersection point of PT and AD. Prove: MF and AO are orthogonal to each other.
