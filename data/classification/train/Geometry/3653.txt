Two equal-sized regular n-gons intersect to form a 2n-gon C. Prove that the sum of the sides of C which form part of one n-gon equals half the perimeter of C. Alternative formulation: Let two equal regular n-gons S and T be located in the plane such that their intersection S cap T is a 2n-gon (with n ge 3). The sides of the polygon S are coloured in red and the sides of T in blue. Prove that the sum of the lengths of the blue sides of the polygon S cap T is equal to the sum of the lengths of its red sides.
