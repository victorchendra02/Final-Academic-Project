Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with angle A = 90^{ circ}. Let K be the midpoint of BC, and let AKLM be a parallelogram with centre C. Let T be the intersection of the line AC and the perpendicular bisector of BM. Let omega_1 be the circle with centre C and radius CA and let omega_2 be the circle with centre T and radius TB. Prove that one of the points of intersection of omega_1 and omega_2 is on the line LM. Proposed by Greece
