It is well-known that if a quadrilateral has the circumcircle and the incircle with the same centre then it is a square. Is the similar statement true in 3 dimensions: namely, if a cuboid is inscribed into a sphere and circumscribed around a sphere and the centres of the spheres coincide, does it imply that the cuboid is a cube? (A cuboid is a polyhedron with 6 quadrilateral faces such that each vertex belongs to 3 edges.) (10 points)
