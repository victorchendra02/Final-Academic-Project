Let ABCD be a parallelogram and let K be a point on line AD such that BK=AB. Suppose that P is an arbitrary point on AB, and the perpendicular bisector of PC intersects the circumcircle of triangle APD at points X, Y. Prove that the circumcircle of triangle ABK passes through the orthocenter of triangle AXY. Proposed by Iman Maghsoudi
