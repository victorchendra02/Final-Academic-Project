Let A, B, and C be three points such that B is the midpoint of segment AC and let P be a point such that <PBC=60. Equilateral triangle PCQ is constructed such that B and Q are on different half=planes with respect to PC, and the equilateral triangle APR is constructed in such a way that B and R are in the same half-plane with respect to AP. Let X be the point of intersection of the lines BQ and PC, and let Y be the point of intersection of the lines BR and AP. Prove that XY and AC are parallel.
