Let S subseteq mathbb{R} be a set of real numbers. We say that a pair (f, g) of functions from S into S is a Spanish Couple on S, if they satisfy the following conditions: (i) Both functions are strictly increasing, i.e. f(x) < f(y) and g(x) < g(y) for all x, y in S with x < y; (ii) The inequality f left(g left(g left(x right) right) right) < g left(f left(x right) right) holds for all x in S. Decide whether there exists a Spanish Couple on the set S = mathbb{N} of positive integers; on the set S = {a - frac {1}{b}: a, b in mathbb{N} } Proposed by Hans Zantema, Netherlands
