Let the sequence a(n), n = 1,2,3, ldots be generated as follows with a(1) = 0, and for n > 1: a(n) = a left( left lfloor frac{n}{2} right rfloor right) + (-1)^{ frac{n(n+1)}{2}}. 1.) Determine the maximum and minimum value of a(n) over n leq 1996 and find all n leq 1996 for which these extreme values are attained. 2.) How many terms a(n), n leq 1996, are equal to 0?
