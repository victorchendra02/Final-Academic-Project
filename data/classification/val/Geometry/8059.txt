Let O, I, and omega be the circumcenter, the incenter, and the incircle of nonequilateral triangle ABC. Let omega_A be the unique circle tangent to AB and AC, such that the common chord of omega_A and omega passes through the center of omega_A . Let O_A be the center of omega_A. Define omega_B, O_B, omega_C, O_C similarly. If omega touches BC, CA, AB at D, E, F respectively, prove that the perpendiculars from D, E, F to O_BO_C , O_CO_A , O_AO_B are concurrent on the line OI.
