Let ABC be an isosceles triangle with AC=BC, whose incentre is I. Let P be a point on the circumcircle of the triangle AIB lying inside the triangle ABC. The lines through P parallel to CA and CB meet AB at D and E, respectively. The line through P parallel to AB meets CA and CB at F and G, respectively. Prove that the lines DF and EG intersect on the circumcircle of the triangle ABC. Proposed by Hojoo Lee
