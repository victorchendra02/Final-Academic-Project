A hexagon convex A_1B_1A_2B_2A_3B_3 it is inscribed in a circumference Omega with radius R. The diagonals A_1B_2, A_2B_3, A_3B_1 are concurrent in X. For each i=1,2,3 let omega_i tangent to the segments XA_i and XB_i and tangent to the arc A_iB_i of Omega that does not contain the other vertices of the hexagon; let r_i the radius of omega_i. (a) Prove that R geq r_1+r_2+r_3 (b) If R= r_1+r_2+r_3, prove that the six points of tangency of the circumferences omega_i with the diagonals A_1B_2, A_2B_3, A_3B_1 are concyclic
