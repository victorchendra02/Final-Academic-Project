Let ABC be an acute triangle and let A_1, B_1, C_1 be points on the sides BC, CA and AB, respectively. Show that the triangles ABC and A_1B_1C_1 are similar ( angle A = angle A_1, angle B = angle B_1, angle C = angle C_1) if and only if the orthocentre of the triangle A_1B_1C_1 and the circumcentre of the triangle ABC coincide.
