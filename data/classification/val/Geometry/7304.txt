Let W be a circle passing through A tangent in M_1 to BC. Let P be the circumcircle of ABC. W is intersecting AC in N and P in M. Prove that MN is perpendicular to BC. SolutionSolution Let M_1 be the midpoint of BC. And let C_1 be the center of W. So, we first show that C_1 in AC. Clearly C_1M_1 perp BC. And also, since M_1 is the center of P as ABC is a right triangle, we have M_1A=M_1B=M_1C. So, angle M_1AB= angle M_1BA=60^{ circ}. And this implies that triangle AM_1B is equilateral. So, angle C_1M_1A=90^{ circ}-60^{ circ}=30^{ circ}= angle C_1AM_1. But then, angle C_1AM_1+ angle M_1AB=90^{ circ}= angle C_1AB= angle CAB. This shows that boxed{C_1 in AC}. Next C_1N=C_1M_1 and angle AC_1M_1=180^{ circ}-30^{ circ}-30^{ circ}=120^{ circ}=180^{ circ}- angle NC_1M_1, showing that triangle NC_1M_1 is equilateral. Again, C_1M=C_1A showing angle C_1AM= angle C_1MA. Now note that AM is the radical axis of P and W. So, M_1C_1 perp AM. Let M_1C_1 cap AM=X. Then, AC_1X=60^{ circ} Rightarrow NC_1M=180^{ circ}- angle MC_1X-60^{ circ}=60^{ circ}. But C_1M=C_1N. Thus angle MNC_1= angle NC_1M Rightarrow MN parallel M_1C_1 Rightarrow boxed{MN perp BC}. This completes the proof. :)
