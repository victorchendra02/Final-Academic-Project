A sequence of 2n + 1 non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n + 1} is given. There's also a sequence of 2n + 1 consecutive cells enumerated from 1 to 2n + 1 from left to right, such that initially the number a_i is written on the i-th cell, for i = 1, 2, ..., 2n + 1. Starting from this initial position, we repeat the following sequence of steps, as long as it's possible: Step 1: Add up the numbers written on all the cells, denote the sum as s. Step 2: If s is equal to 0 or if it is larger than the current number of cells, the process terminates. Otherwise, remove the s-th cell, and shift shift all cells that are to the right of it one position to the left. Then go to Step 1. Example: (1, 0, 1, underline{2}, 0) rightarrow (1, underline{0}, 1, 0) rightarrow (1, underline{1}, 0) rightarrow ( underline{1}, 0) rightarrow (0). A sequence a_1, a_2,. . . , a_{2n+1} of non-negative integers is called balanced, if at the end of this process theres exactly one cell left, and its the cell that was initially enumerated by (n + 1), i.e. the cell that was initially in the middle. Find the total number of balanced sequences as a function of n. Proposed by Viktor Simjanoski, North Macedonia
