A town-planner has built an isolated city whose road network consists of 2N roundabouts, each connecting exactly three roads. A series of tunnels and bridges ensure that all roads in the town meet only at roundabouts. All roads are two-way, and each roundabout is oriented clockwise. Vlad has recently passed his driving test, and is nervous about roundabouts. He starts driving from his house, and always takes the first edit at each roundabout he encounters. It turns out his journey incluldes every road in the town in both directions before he arrives back at the starting point in the starting direction. For what values of N is this possible?
