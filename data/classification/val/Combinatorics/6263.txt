Let P is a regular (2n+1)-gon in the plane, where n is a positive integer. We say that a point S on one of the sides of P can be seen from a point E that is external to P , if the line segment overline{ES} contains no other points that lie on the sides of P except S . We want to color the sides of P in 3 colors, such that every side is colored in exactly one color, and each color must be used at least once. Moreover, from every point in the plane external to P , at most 2 different colors on P can be seen (ignore the vertices of P , we consider them colorless). Find the largest positive integer n for which such a coloring is possible.
