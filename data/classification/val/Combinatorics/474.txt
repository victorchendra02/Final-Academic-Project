Determine the largest integer N for which there exists a table T of integers with N rows and 100 columns that has the following properties: text{(i)} Every row contains the numbers 1, 2, ldots, 100 in some order. text{(ii)} For any two distinct rows r and s, there is a column c such that |T(r,c) - T(s, c)| geq 2. (Here T(r,c) is the entry in row r and column c.)
