Inside a 2 times 2 square, lines parallel to a side of the square (both horizontal and vertical) are drawn thereby dividing the square into rectangles. The rectangles are alternately colored black and white like a chessboard. Prove that if the total area of the white rectangles is equal to the total area of the black rectangles, then one can cut out the black rectangles and reassemble them into a 1 times 2 rectangle.
