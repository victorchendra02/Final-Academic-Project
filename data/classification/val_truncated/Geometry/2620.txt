In the triangle ABC, let B_1 be on AC, E on AB, G on BC, and let EG be parallel to AC. Furthermore, let EG be tangent to the inscribed circle of the triangle ABB_1 and intersect BB_1 at F. Let r, r_1, and r_2 be the inradii of the triangles ABC, ABB_1, and BFG, respectively. Prove that r = r_1 + r_2.
