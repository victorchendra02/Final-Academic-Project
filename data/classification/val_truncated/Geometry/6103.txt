Let ABC be a triangle with circumcircle Omega. Let S_b and S_c respectively denote the midpoints of the arcs AC and AB that do not contain the third vertex. Let N_a denote the midpoint of arc BAC (the arc BC including A). Let I be the incenter of ABC. Let omega_b be the circle that is tangent to AB and internally tangent to Omega at S_b, and let omega_c be the circle that is tangent to AC and internally tangent to Omega at S_c. Show that the line IN_a, and the lines through the intersections of omega_b and omega_c, meet on Omega.
