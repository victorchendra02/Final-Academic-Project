Suppose that ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral. Let E = AC cap BD and F = AB cap CD. Denote by H_{1} and H_{2} the orthocenters of triangles EAD and EBC, respectively. Prove that the points F, H_{1}, H_{2} are collinear. Original formulation: Let ABC be a triangle. A circle passing through B and C intersects the sides AB and AC again at C' and B', respectively. Prove that BB', CC' and HH' are concurrent, where H and H' are the orthocentres of triangles ABC and AB'C' respectively.
