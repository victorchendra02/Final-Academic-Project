Let n be a positive integer. Dominoes are placed on a 2n times 2n board in such a way that every cell of the board is adjacent to exactly one cell covered by a domino. For each n, determine the largest number of dominoes that can be placed in this way. (A domino is a tile of size 2 times 1 or 1 times 2. Dominoes are placed on the board in such a way that each domino covers exactly two cells of the board, and dominoes do not overlap. Two cells are said to be adjacent if they are different and share a common side.)
