Let k and s be positive integers such that s<(2k + 1)^2. Initially, one cell out of an n times n grid is coloured green. On each turn, we pick some green cell c and colour green some s out of the (2k + 1)^2 cells in the (2k + 1) times (2k + 1) square centred at c. No cell may be coloured green twice. We say that s is k-sparse if there exists some positive number C such that, for every positive integer n, the total number of green cells after any number of turns is always going to be at most Cn. Find, in terms of k, the least k-sparse integer s. Proposed by Nikolai Beluhov.
