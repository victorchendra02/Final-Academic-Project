The following operation is allowed on a finite graph: Choose an arbitrary cycle of length 4 (if there is any), choose an arbitrary edge in that cycle, and delete it from the graph. For a fixed integer {n ge 4}, find the least number of edges of a graph that can be obtained by repeated applications of this operation from the complete graph on n vertices (where each pair of vertices are joined by an edge).
