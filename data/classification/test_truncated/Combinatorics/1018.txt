Let x_1, ldots, x_n and y_1, ldots, y_n be real numbers. Let A = (a_{ij})_{1 leq i,j leq n} be the matrix with entries a_{ij} = begin{cases}1,& text{if }x_i + y_j geq 0; 0,& text{if }x_i + y_j < 0. end{cases}Suppose that B is an n times n matrix with entries 0, 1 such that the sum of the elements in each row and each column of B is equal to the corresponding sum for the matrix A. Prove that A=B.
