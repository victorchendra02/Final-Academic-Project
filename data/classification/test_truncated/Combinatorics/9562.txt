Nine pawns forming a 3 by 3 square are placed in the lower left hand corner of an 8 by 8 chessboard. Any pawn may jump over another one standing next to it into a free square, i .e. may be reflected symmetrically with respect to a neighb our's centre (jumps may be horizontal , vertical or diagonal) . It is required to rearrange the nine pawns in another corner of the chessboard (in another 3 by 3 square) by means of such jumps. Can the pawns be thus re-arranged in the (a) upper left hand corner? (b) upper right hand corner? (J . E . Briskin)
