Ten points are marked in the plane so that no three of them lie on a line. Each pair of points is connected with a segment. Each of these segments is painted with one of k colors, in such a way that for any k of the ten points, there are k segments each joining two of them and no two being painted with the same color. Determine all integers k, 1 leq k leq 10, for which this is possible.
