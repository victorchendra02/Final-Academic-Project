Given a paper on which the numbers 1,2,3 dots ,14,15 are written. Andy and Bobby are bored and perform the following operations, Andy chooses any two numbers (say x and y) on the paper, erases them, and writes the sum of the numbers on the initial paper. Meanwhile, Bobby writes the value of xy(x+y) in his book. They were so bored that they both performed the operation until only 1 number remained. Then Bobby adds up all the numbers he wrote in his book, lets call k as the sum. a. Prove that k is constant which means it does not matter how they perform the operation, b. Find the value of k.
