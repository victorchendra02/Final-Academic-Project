A number of N children are at a party and they sit in a circle to play a game of Pass and Parcel. Because the host has no other form of entertainment, the parcel has infinitely many layers. On turn i, starting with i=1, the following two things happen in order: (1) The parcel is passed i^2 positions clockwise; and (2) The child currently holding the parcel unwraps a layer and claims the prize inside. For what values of N will every chidren receive a prize? Patrick Winter , United Kingdom
