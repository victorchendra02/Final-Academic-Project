Find the smallest positive integer k for which there exists a colouring of the positive integers mathbb{Z}_{>0} with k colours and a function f: mathbb{Z}_{>0} to mathbb{Z}_{>0} with the following two properties: (i) For all positive integers m,n of the same colour, f(m+n)=f(m)+f(n). (ii) There are positive integers m,n such that f(m+n) ne f(m)+f(n). In a colouring of mathbb{Z}_{>0} with k colours, every integer is coloured in exactly one of the k colours. In both (i) and (ii) the positive integers m,n are not necessarily distinct.
