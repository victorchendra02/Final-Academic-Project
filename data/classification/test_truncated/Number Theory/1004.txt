Let b be an integer greater than 5. For each positive integer n, consider the number x_n = underbrace{11 cdots1}_{n - 1} underbrace{22 cdots2}_{n}5, written in base b. Prove that the following condition holds if and only if b = 10: there exists a positive integer M such that for any integer n greater than M, the number x_n is a perfect square.
