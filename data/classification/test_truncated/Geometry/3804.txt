Let P be the intersection of lines l_1 and l_2. Let S_1 and S_2 be two circles externally tangent at P and both tangent to l_1, and let T_1 and T_2 be two circles externally tangent at P and both tangent to l_2. Let A be the second intersection of S_1 and T_1, B that of S_1 and T_2, C that of S_2 and T_1, and D that of S_2 and T_2. Show that the points A,B,C,D are concyclic if and only if l_1 and l_2 are perpendicular.
