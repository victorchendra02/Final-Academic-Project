Let ABC be an acute triangle inscribed in a circle omega with center O. Points E, F lie on its side AC, AB, respectively, such that O lies on EF and BCEF is cyclic. Let R, S be the intersections of EF with the shorter arcs AB, AC of omega, respectively. Suppose K, L are the reflection of R about C and the reflection of S about B, respectively. Suppose that points P and Q lie on the lines BS and RC, respectively, such that PK and QL are perpendicular to BC. Prove that the circle with center P and radius PK is tangent to the circumcircle of RCE if and only if the circle with center Q and radius QL is tangent to the circumcircle of BFS.
