Let ABC be an acute triangle with AC > AB and circumcircle Gamma. The tangent from A to Gamma intersects BC at T. Let M be the midpoint of BC and let R be the reflection of A in B. Let S be a point so that SABT is a parallelogram and finally let P be a point on line SB such that MP is parallel to AB. Given that P lies on Gamma, prove that the circumcircle of triangle STR is tangent to line AC. Proposed by Sam Bealing, United Kingdom
