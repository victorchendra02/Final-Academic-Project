Let ABC be a triangle with incenter I, and A-excenter Gamma. Let A_1,B_1,C_1 be the points of tangency of Gamma with BC,AC and AB, respectively. Suppose IA_1, IB_1 and IC_1 intersect Gamma for the second time at points A_2,B_2,C_2, respectively. M is the midpoint of segment AA_1. If the intersection of A_1B_1 and A_2B_2 is X, and the intersection of A_1C_1 and A_2C_2 is Y, prove that MX=MY.
