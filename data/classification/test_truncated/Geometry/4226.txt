Given an acute triangle ABC, (c) its circumcircle with center O and H the orthocenter of the triangle ABC. The line AO intersects (c) at the point D. Let D_1, D_2 and H_2, H_3 be the symmetrical points of the points D and H with respect to the lines AB, AC respectively. Let (c_1) be the circumcircle of the triangle AD_1D_2. Suppose that the line AH intersects again (c_1) at the point U, the line H_2H_3 intersects the segment D_1D_2 at the point K_1 and the line DH_3 intersects the segment UD_2 at the point L_1. Prove that one of the intersection points of the circumcircles of the triangles D_1K_1H_2 and UDL_1 lies on the line K_1L_1.
