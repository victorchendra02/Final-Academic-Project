Let ABC be an acute scalene triangle. Its C-excircle tangent to the segment AB meets AB at point M and the extension of BC beyond B at point N. Analogously, its B-excircle tangent to the segment AC meets AC at point P and the extension of BC beyond C at point Q. Denote by A_1 the intersection point of the lines MN and PQ, and let A_2 be defined as the point, symmetric to A with respect to A_1. Define the points B_2 and C_2, analogously. Prove that triangle ABC is similar to triangle A_2B_2C_2.
