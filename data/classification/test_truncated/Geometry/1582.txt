Let alpha, beta and gamma denote the angles of the triangle ABC. The perpendicular bisector of AB intersects BC at the point X, the perpendicular bisector of AC intersects it at Y. Prove that tan( beta) cdot tan( gamma) = 3 implies BC= XY (or in other words: Prove that a sufficient condition for BC = XY is tan( beta) cdot tan( gamma) = 3). Show that this condition is not necessary, and give a necessary and sufficient condition for BC = XY.
