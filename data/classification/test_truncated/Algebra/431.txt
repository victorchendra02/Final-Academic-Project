Let mathbb R be the set of real numbers. We denote by mathcal F the set of all functions f colon mathbb R to mathbb R such that f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + f(y)for every x,y in mathbb R Find all rational numbers q such that for every function f in mathcal F, there exists some z in mathbb R satisfying f(z)=qz.
