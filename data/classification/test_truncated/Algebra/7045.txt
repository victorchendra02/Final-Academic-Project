mathbb{Z}[x] represents the set of all polynomials with integer coefficients. Find all functions f: mathbb{Z}[x] rightarrow mathbb{Z}[x] such that for any 2 polynomials P,Q with integer coefficients and integer r, the following statement is true. P(r) mid Q(r) iff f(P)(r) mid f(Q)(r). (We define a|b if and only if b=za for some integer z. In particular, 0|0.) Proposed by the4seasons.
