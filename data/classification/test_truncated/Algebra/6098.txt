There are n ge 3 positive real numbers a_1, a_2, dots, a_n. For each 1 le i le n we let b_i = frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{a_i} (here we define a_0 to be a_n and a_{n+1} to be a_1). Assume that for all i and j in the range 1 to n, we have a_i le a_j if and only if b_i le b_j. Prove that a_1 = a_2 = dots = a_n.
