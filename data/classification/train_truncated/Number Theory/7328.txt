Alice chooses a prime number p > 2 and then Bob chooses a positive integer n_0. Alice, in the first move, chooses an integer n_1 > n_0 and calculates the expression s_1 = n_0^{n_1} + n_1^{n_0}; then Bob, in the second move, chooses an integer n_2 > n_1 and calculates the expression s_2 = n_1^{n_2} + n_2^{n_1}; etc. one by one. (Each player knows the numbers chosen by the other in the previous moves.) The winner is the one who first chooses the number n_k such that p divides s_k(s_1 + 2s_2 + + ks_k). Who has a winning strategy? Proposed by Borche Joshevski, Macedonia
