a) Suppose that n is an odd integer. Prove that k(n-k) is divisible by 2 for all positive integers k. b) Find an integer k such that k(100-k) is not divisible by 11. c) Suppose that p is an odd prime, and n is an integer. Prove that there is an integer k such that k(n-k) is not divisible by p. d) Suppose that p,q are two different odd primes, and n is an integer. Prove that there is an integer k such that k(n-k) is not divisible by any of p,q.
