Let p(x) be a polynomial with integer coefficients such that p(0)=p(1)=1. We define the sequence a_0, a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n, ldots that starts with an arbitrary nonzero integer a_0 and satisfies a_{n+1}=p(a_n) for all n in mathbb N cup {0 }. Prove that gcd(a_i,a_j)=1 for all i,j in mathbb N cup {0 }.
