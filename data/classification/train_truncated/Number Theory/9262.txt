Determine all integers n ge 3 whose decimal expansion has less than 20 digits, such that every quadratic non-residue modulo n is a primitive root modulo n. An integer a is a quadratic non-residue modulo n, if there is no integer b such that a - b^2 is divisible by n. An integer a is a primitive root modulo n, if for every integer b relatively prime to n there is a positive integer k such that a^k - b is divisible by n.
