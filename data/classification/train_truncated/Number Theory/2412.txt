Let x_1, x_2, cdots, x_n be n integers. Let n = p + q, where p and q are positive integers. For i = 1, 2, cdots, n, put S_i = x_i + x_{i+1} + cdots + x_{i+p-1} text{ and } T_i = x_{i+p} + x_{i+p+1} + cdots + x_{i+n-1} (it is assumed that x_{i+n }= x_i for all i). Next, let m(a, b) be the number of indices i for which S_i leaves the remainder a and T_i leaves the remainder b on division by 3, where a, b in {0, 1, 2 }. Show that m(1, 2) and m(2, 1) leave the same remainder when divided by 3.
