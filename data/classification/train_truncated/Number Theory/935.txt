Let a > b > 1 be relatively prime positive integers. Define the weight of an integer c, denoted by w(c) to be the minimal possible value of |x| + |y| taken over all pairs of integers x and y such that ax + by = c. An integer c is called a local champion if w(c) geq w(c pm a) and w(c) geq w(c pm b). Find all local champions and determine their number. Proposed by Zoran Sunic, USA
