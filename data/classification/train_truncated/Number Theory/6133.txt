Prove that for every real number t such that 0 < t < tfrac{1}{2} there exists a positive integer n with the following property: for every set S of n positive integers there exist two different elements x and y of S, and a non-negative integer m (i.e. m ge 0 ), such that |x-my| leq ty. Determine whether for every real number t such that 0 < t < tfrac{1}{2} there exists an infinite set S of positive integers such that |x-my| > tyfor every pair of different elements x and y of S and every positive integer m (i.e. m > 0).
