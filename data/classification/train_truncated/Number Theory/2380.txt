Let p be the product of two consecutive integers greater than 2. Show that there are no integers x_1, x_2, ldots, x_p satisfying the equation sum^p_{i = 1} x^2_i - frac {4}{4 cdot p + 1} left( sum^p_{i = 1} x_i right)^2 = 1 OR Show that there are only two values of p for which there are integers x_1, x_2, ldots, x_p satisfying sum^p_{i = 1} x^2_i - frac {4}{4 cdot p + 1} left( sum^p_{i = 1} x_i right)^2 = 1
