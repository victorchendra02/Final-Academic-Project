Does there exist a nonnegative integer a for which the equation left lfloor frac{m}{1} right rfloor + left lfloor frac{m}{2} right rfloor + left lfloor frac{m}{3} right rfloor + cdots + left lfloor frac{m}{m} right rfloor = n^2 + ahas more than one million different solutions (m, n) where m and n are positive integers? The expression lfloor x rfloor denotes the integer part (or floor) of the real number x. Thus lfloor sqrt{2} rfloor = 1, lfloor pi rfloor = lfloor 22/7 rfloor = 3, lfloor 42 rfloor = 42, and lfloor 0 rfloor = 0.
