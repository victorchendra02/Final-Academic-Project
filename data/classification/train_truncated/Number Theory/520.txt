Determine all functions f defined on the set of all positive integers and taking non-negative integer values, satisfying the three conditions: (i) f(n) neq 0 for at least one n; (ii) f(x y)=f(x)+f(y) for every positive integers x and y; (iii) there are infinitely many positive integers n such that f(k)=f(n-k) for all k<n.
