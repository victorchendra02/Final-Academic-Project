Let ABC be a triangle and Gamma its circumcircle. Denote Delta the tangent at A to the circle Gamma. Gamma_1 is a circle tangent to the lines Delta, (AB) and (BC), and E its touchpoint with the line (AB). Let Gamma_2 be a circle tangent to the lines Delta, (AC) and (BC), and F its touchpoint with the line (AC). We suppose that E and F belong respectively to the segments [AB] and [AC], and that the two circles Gamma_1 and Gamma_2 lie outside triangle ABC. Show that the lines (BC) and (EF) are parallel.
