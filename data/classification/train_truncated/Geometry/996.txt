Let ABC be a triangle and let P be a point in its interior. Denote by D, E, F the feet of the perpendiculars from P to the lines BC, CA, AB, respectively. Suppose that AP^2 + PD^2 = BP^2 + PE^2 = CP^2 + PF^2.Denote by I_A, I_B, I_C the excenters of the triangle ABC. Prove that P is the circumcenter of the triangle I_AI_BI_C. Proposed by C.R.
