Let ABC be a triangle and let D, E are points on its circumscribed circle, such that D lies on arc AB, E lies on arc AC (smaller arcs) and BD parallel CE . Let the point F be the intersection of the lines DA and CE, and the intersection of the lines EA and BD is G. Let P be the second intersection of the circumscribed circles of vartriangle ABG and vartriangle ACF. Prove that the line AP passes through the mid point of the side BC.
