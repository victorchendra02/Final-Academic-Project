C is a point on the semicircle diameter AB, between A and B. D is the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB. The circle K_1 is the incircle of ABC, the circle K_2 touches CD,DA and the semicircle, the circle K_3 touches CD,DB and the semicircle. Prove that K_1,K_2 and K_3 have another common tangent apart from AB.
