Let ABC be a triangle and let H be the orthogonal projection of A on the line BC. Let K be a point on the segment AH such that AH = 3 KH. Let O be the circumcenter of triangle ABC and let M and N be the midpoints of sides AC and AB respectively. The lines KO and MN meet at a point Z and the perpendicular at Z to OK meets lines AB, AC at X and Y respectively. Show that angle XKY = angle CKB. Italy
