Consider a triangle ABC with altitudes AD, BE, and CF, and orthocenter H. Let the perpendicular line from H to EF intersects EF, AB and AC at P, T and L, respectively. Point K lies on the side BC such that BD=KC. Let omega be a circle that passes through H and P, that is tangent to AH. Prove that circumcircle of triangle ATL and omega are tangent, and KH passes through the tangency point.
