In triangle ABC ( angle A neq 90^ circ), let O, H be the circumcenter and the foot of the altitude from A respectively. Suppose M, N are the midpoints of BC, AH respectively. Let D be the intersection of AO and BC and let H' be the reflection of H about M. Suppose that the circumcircle of OH'D intersects the circumcircle of BOC at E. Prove that NO and AE are concurrent on the circumcircle of BOC. Proposed by Mehran Talaei
