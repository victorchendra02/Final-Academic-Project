A circle is inscribed in a triangle ABC with sides a,b,c. Tangents to the circle parallel to the sides of the triangle are contructe. Each of these tangents cuts off a triagnle from triangle ABC. In each of these triangles, a circle is inscribed. Find the sum of the areas of all four inscribed circles (in terms of a,b,c).
