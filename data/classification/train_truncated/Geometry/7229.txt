Convex circumscribed quadrilateral ABCD with its incenter I is given such that its incircle is tangent to overline{AD}, overline{DC}, overline{CB}, and overline{BA} at K,L,M, and N. Lines overline{AD} and overline{BC} meet at E and lines overline{AB} and overline{CD} meet at F. Let overline{KM} intersects overline{AB} and overline{CD} at X,Y, respectively. Let overline{LN} intersects overline{AD} and overline{BC} at Z,T, respectively. Prove that the circumcircle of triangle triangle XFY and the circle with diameter EI are tangent if and only if the circumcircle of triangle triangle TEZ and the circle with diameter FI are tangent.
