Let ABCD be a parallelogram. A variable line g through the vertex A intersects the rays BC and DC at the points X and Y, respectively. Let K and L be the A-excenters of the triangles ABX and ADY. Show that the angle measuredangle KCL is independent of the line g. Proposed by Vyacheslev Yasinskiy, Ukraine
