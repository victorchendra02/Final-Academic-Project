Let O be the circumcentre, and Omega be the circumcircle of an acute-angled triangle ABC. Let P be an arbitrary point on Omega, distinct from A, B, C, and their antipodes in Omega. Denote the circumcentres of the triangles AOP, BOP, and COP by O_A, O_B, and O_C, respectively. The lines ell_A, ell_B, ell_C perpendicular to BC, CA, and AB pass through O_A, O_B, and O_C, respectively. Prove that the circumcircle of triangle formed by ell_A, ell_B, and ell_C is tangent to the line OP.
