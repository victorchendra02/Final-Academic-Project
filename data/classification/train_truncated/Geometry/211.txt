Consider 2 concentric circle radii R and r ( R > r) with centre O. Fix P on the small circle and consider the variable chord PA of the small circle. Points B and C lie on the large circle; B,P,C are collinear and BC is perpendicular to AP. i.) For which values of angle OPA is the sum BC^2 + CA^2 + AB^2 extremal? ii.) What are the possible positions of the midpoints U of BA and V of AC as angle OPA varies?
