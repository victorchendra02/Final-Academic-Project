Let ABC be an acute triangle such that CA neq CB with circumcircle omega and circumcentre O. Let t_A and t_B be the tangents to omega at A and B respectively, which meet at X. Let Y be the foot of the perpendicular from O onto the line segment CX. The line through C parallel to line AB meets t_A at Z. Prove that the line YZ passes through the midpoint of the line segment AC. Proposed by Dominic Yeo, United Kingdom
