Let ABC be an isosceles triangle with AB = AC and angle A = 45^o. Its circumcircle (c) has center O, M is the midpoint of BC and D is the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB. With center C and radius CD we draw a circle which internally intersects AC at the point F and the circle (c) at the points Z and E, such that Z lies on the small arc BC and E on the small arc AC. Prove that the lines ZE, CO, FM are concurrent. Brazitikos Silouanos, Greece
