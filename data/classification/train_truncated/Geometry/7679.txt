Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with AB=AD and BC=CD. On the sides AB,BC,CD,DA we consider points K,L,L_1,K_1 such that quadrilateral KLL_1K_1 is rectangle. Then consider rectangles MNPQ inscribed in the triangle BLK, where M in KB,N in BL,P,Q in LK and M_1N_1P_1Q_1 inscribed in triangle DK_1L_1 where P_1 and Q_1 are situated on the L_1K_1, M on the DK_1 and N_1 on the DL_1. Let S,S_1,S_2,S_3 be the areas of the ABCD,KLL_1K_1,MNPQ,M_1N_1P_1Q_1 respectively. Find the maximum possible value of the expression: frac{S_1+S_2+S_3}{S}
