Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle with AB < AC. Let Omega be the circumcircle of ABC. Let S be the midpoint of the arc CB of Omega containing A. The perpendicular from A to BC meets BS at D and meets Omega again at E neq A. The line through D parallel to BC meets line BE at L. Denote the circumcircle of triangle BDL by omega. Let omega meet Omega again at P neq B. Prove that the line tangent to omega at P meets line BS on the internal angle bisector of angle BAC.
