Let M be a point in the interior of triangle ABC. Let A' lie on BC with MA' perpendicular to BC. Define B' on CA and C' on AB similarly. Define p(M) = frac{MA' cdot MB' cdot MC'}{MA cdot MB cdot MC}. Determine, with proof, the location of M such that p(M) is maximal. Let mu(ABC) denote this maximum value. For which triangles ABC is the value of mu(ABC) maximal?
