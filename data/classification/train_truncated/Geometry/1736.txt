All faces of the tetrahedron ABCD are acute-angled. Take a point X in the interior of the segment AB, and similarly Y in BC, Z in CD and T in AD. a.) If angle DAB+ angle BCD ne angle CDA+ angle ABC, then prove none of the closed paths XYZTX has minimal length; b.) If angle DAB+ angle BCD= angle CDA+ angle ABC, then there are infinitely many shortest paths XYZTX, each with length 2AC sin k, where 2k= angle BAC+ angle CAD+ angle DAB.
