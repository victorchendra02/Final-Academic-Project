Let mathcal{C} be a circle with center O, and let A be a point outside the circle. Let the two tangents from the point A to the circle mathcal{C} meet this circle at the points S and T, respectively. Given a point M on the circle mathcal{C} which is different from the points S and T, let the line MA meet the perpendicular from the point S to the line MO at P. Prove that the reflection of the point S in the point P lies on the line MT.
