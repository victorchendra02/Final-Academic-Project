Given are two circles which intersect at points P and Q. Consider an arbitrary line ell through Q, let the second points of intersection of this line with the circles be A and B respectively. Let C be the point of intersection of the tangents to the circles in those points. Let D be the intersection of the line AB and the bisector of the angle CPQ. Prove that all possible D for any choice of ell lie on a single circle. Alexey Zaslavsky
