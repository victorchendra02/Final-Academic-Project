Let ABC be a triangle such that measuredangle BAC = 60^{ circ}. Let D and E be the feet of the perpendicular from A to the bisectors of the external angles of B and C in triangle ABC, respectively. Let O be the circumcenter of the triangle ABC. Prove that circumcircle of the triangle BOC has exactly one point in common with the circumcircle of ADE.
