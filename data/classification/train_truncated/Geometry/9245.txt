Let ABC be a triangle. Consider the circle omega_B internally tangent to the sides BC and BA, and to the circumcircle of the triangle ABC, let P be the point of contact of the two circles. Similarly, consider the circle omega_C internally tangent to the sides CB and CA, and to the circumcircle of the triangle ABC, let Q be the point of contact of the two circles. Show that the incentre of the triangle ABC lies on the segment PQ if and only if AB + AC = 3BC. proposed by Luis Eduardo Garcia Hernandez, Mexico
