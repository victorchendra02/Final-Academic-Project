Let triangle ABC be an acute-angled triangle with its incenter I. Suppose that N is the midpoint of the arc overarc{BAC} of the circumcircle of triangle triangle ABC, and P is a point such that ABPC is a parallelogram.Let Q be the reflection of A over N and R the projection of A on overline{QI}. Show that the line overline{AI} is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle triangle PQR Proposed by Patrik Bak - Slovakia
