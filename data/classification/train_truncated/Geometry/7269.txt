Let X,Y be two points on the side BC of triangle ABC such that 2XY=BC (X is between B,Y). Let AA' be the diameter of the circumcirle of triangle AXY. Let P be the point where AX meets the perpendicular from B to BC, and Q be the point where AY meets the perpendicular from C to BC. Prove that the tangent line from A' to the circumcircle of AXY passes through the circumcenter of triangle APQ. Proposed by Iman Maghsoudi
