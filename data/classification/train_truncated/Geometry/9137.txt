Consider an arc AB of a circle C and a point P variable in that arc AB. Let D be the midpoint of the arc AP that doeas not contain B and let E be the midpoint of the arc BP that does not contain A. Let C_1 be the circle with center D passing through A and C_2 be the circle with center E passing through B. Prove that the line that contains the intersection points of C_1 and C_2 passes through a fixed point.
