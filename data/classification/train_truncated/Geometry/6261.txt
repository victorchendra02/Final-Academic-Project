Let ABC be an acute triangle, where AB is the smallest side and let D be the midpoint of AB. Let P be a point in the interior of the triangle ABC such that angle CAP = angle CBP = angle ACB. From the point P, we draw perpendicular lines on BC and AC where the intersection point with BC is M, and with AC is N . Through the point M we draw a line parallel to AC, and through N parallel to BC. These lines intercept at the point K. Prove that D is the center of the circumscribed circle for the triangle MNK.
