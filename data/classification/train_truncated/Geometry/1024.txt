Circles S_1 and S_2 intersect at points P and Q. Distinct points A_1 and B_1 (not at P or Q) are selected on S_1. The lines A_1P and B_1P meet S_2 again at A_2 and B_2 respectively, and the lines A_1B_1 and A_2B_2 meet at C. Prove that, as A_1 and B_1 vary, the circumcentres of triangles A_1A_2C all lie on one fixed circle.
