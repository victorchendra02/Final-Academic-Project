Let P and Q be the midpoints of the sides BC and CD, respectively in a rectangle ABCD. Let K and M be the intersections of the line PD with the lines QB and QA, respectively, and let N be the intersection of the lines PA and QB. Let X, Y and Z be the midpoints of the segments AN, KN and AM, respectively. Let ell_1 be the line passing through X and perpendicular to MK, ell_2 be the line passing through Y and perpendicular to AM and ell_3 the line passing through Z and perpendicular to KN. Prove that the lines ell_1, ell_2 and ell_3 are concurrent.
