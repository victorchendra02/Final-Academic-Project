In the plane, consider a point X and a polygon mathcal{F} (which is not necessarily convex). Let p denote the perimeter of mathcal{F}, let d be the sum of the distances from the point X to the vertices of mathcal{F}, and let h be the sum of the distances from the point X to the sidelines of mathcal{F}. Prove that d^2 - h^2 geq frac {p^2}{4}.
