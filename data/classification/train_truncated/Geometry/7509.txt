Let O_1 be a point in the exterior of the circle omega of center O and radius R , and let O_1N , O_1D be the tangent segments from O_1 to the circle. On the segment O_1N consider the point B such that BN=R .Let the line from B parallel to ON intersect the segment O_1D at C . If A is a point on the segment O_1D other than C so that BC=BA=a , and if the incircle of the triangle ABC has radius r , then find the area of triangle ABC in terms of a ,R ,r.
