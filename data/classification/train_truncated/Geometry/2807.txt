In a plane we are given two distinct points A,B and two lines a, b passing through B and A respectively (a ni B, b ni A) such that the line AB is equally inclined to a and b. Find the locus of points M in the plane such that the product of distances from M to A and a equals the product of distances from M to B and b (i.e., MA cdot MA' = MB cdot MB', where A' and B' are the feet of the perpendiculars from M to a and b respectively).
