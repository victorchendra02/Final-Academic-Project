Let ABC be an acute triangle such that AB < AC. Let omega be the circumcircle of ABC and assume that the tangent to omega at A intersects the line BC at D. Let Omega be the circle with center D and radius AD. Denote by E the second intersection point of omega and Omega. Let M be the midpoint of BC. If the line BE meets Omega again at X, and the line CX meets Omega for the second time at Y, show that A, Y, and M are collinear. Proposed by Nikola Velov, North Macedonia
