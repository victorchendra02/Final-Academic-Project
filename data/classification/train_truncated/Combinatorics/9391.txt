In each unit cell of a finite set of cells of an infinite checkered board, an integer is written so that the sum of the numbers in each row, as well as in each column, is divided by 2002. Prove that every number alpha can be replaced by a certain number alpha' , divisible by 2002 so that | alpha- alpha'| <2002 and the sum of the numbers in all rows, and in all columns will not change.
