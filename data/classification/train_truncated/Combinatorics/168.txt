Let p,q,n be three positive integers with p + q < n. Let (x_{0},x_{1}, cdots ,x_{n}) be an (n + 1)-tuple of integers satisfying the following conditions : (a) x_{0} = x_{n} = 0, and (b) For each i with 1 leq i leq n, either x_{i} - x_{i - 1} = p or x_{i} - x_{i - 1} = - q. Show that there exist indices i < j with (i,j) neq (0,n), such that x_{i} = x_{j}.
