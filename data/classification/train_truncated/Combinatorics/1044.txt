Let T be the set of ordered triples (x,y,z), where x,y,z are integers with 0 leq x,y,z leq9. Players A and B play the following guessing game. Player A chooses a triple (x,y,z) in T, and Player B has to discover A's triple in as few moves as possible. A move consists of the following: B gives A a triple (a,b,c) in T, and A replies by giving B the number left|x+y-a-b right |+ left|y+z-b-c right|+ left|z+x-c-a right|. Find the minimum number of moves that B needs to be sure of determining A's triple.
