Call a point in the Cartesian plane with integer coordinates a lattice point. Given a finite set mathcal{S} of lattice points we repeatedly perform the following operation: given two distinct lattice points A, B in mathcal{S} and two distinct lattice points C, D not in mathcal{S} such that ACBD is a parallelogram with AB > CD, we replace A, B by C, D. Show that only finitely many such operations can be performed. Proposed by Joe Benton, United Kingdom.
