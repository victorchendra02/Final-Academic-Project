Let p(n) be the number of partitions of the natural number n into natural summands. The diversity of a partition is by definition the number of different summands in it. Denote by q(n) the sum of the diversities of all the p(n) partitions of n. (For example, p(4) = 5, the five distinct partitions of 4 being 4, 3 + 1, 2+2, 2 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, and g(4) =1 + 2+1+ 2+1 = 7.) Prove that, for all natural numbers n, (a) q(n)= 1 + P(1) + P(2) + p(3) + ...+ p(n -1), (b) q(n) < sqrt{2n} p(n). (AV Zelevinskiy, Moscow)
