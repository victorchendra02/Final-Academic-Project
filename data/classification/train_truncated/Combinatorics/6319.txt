One country consists of islands A_1,A_2, cdots,A_N,The ministry of transport decided to build some bridges such that anyone will can travel by car from any of the islands A_1,A_2, cdots,A_N to any another island by one or more of these bridges. For technical reasons the only bridges that can be built is between A_i and A_{i+1} where i = 1,2, cdots,N-1 , and between A_i and A_N where i<N. We say that a plan to build some bridges is good if it is satisfies the above conditions , but when we remove any bridge it will not satisfy this conditions. We assume that there is a_N of good plans. Observe that a_1 = 1 (The only good plan is to not build any bridge) , and a_2 = 1 (We build one bridge). 1-Prove that a_3 = 3 2-Draw at least 5 different good plans in the case that N=4 and the islands are the vertices of a square 3-Compute a_4 4-Compute a_6 5-Prove that there is a positive integer i such that 1438 divides a_i
