The sequence a_1,a_2, dots of integers satisfies the conditions: (i) 1 le a_j le2015 for all j ge1, (ii) k+a_k neq ell+a_ ell for all 1 le k< ell. Prove that there exist two positive integers b and N for which left vert sum_{j=m+1}^n(a_j-b) right vert le1007^2for all integers m and n such that n>m ge N.
