A ternary sequence is one whose terms all lie in the set {0, 1, 2 }. Let w be a length n ternary sequence (a_1, ldots,a_n). Prove that w can be extended leftwards and rightwards to a length m=6n ternary sequence (d_1, ldots,d_m) = (b_1, ldots,b_p,a_1, ldots,a_n,c_1, ldots,c_q), quad p,q geqslant 0,containing no length t > 2n palindromic subsequence. (A sequence is called palindromic if it reads the same rightwards and leftwards. A length t subsequence of (d_1, ldots,d_m) is a sequence of the form (d_{i_1}, ldots,d_{i_t}), where 1 leqslant i_1< cdots<i_t leqslant m.)
