On a 5 times 5 board, n white markers are positioned, each marker in a distinct 1 times 1 square. A smart child got an assignment to recolor in black as many markers as possible, in the following manner: a white marker is taken from the board, it is colored in black, and then put back on the board on an empty square such that none of the neighboring squares contains a white marker (two squares are called neighboring if they share a common side). If it is possible for the child to succeed in coloring all the markers black, we say that the initial positioning of the markers was good. a) Prove that if n = 20, then a good initial positioning exists. b) Prove that if n = 21, then a good initial positioning does not exist.
