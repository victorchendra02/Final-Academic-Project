There are n geq 2 coins numbered from 1 to n. These coins are placed around a circle, not necessarily in order. In each turn, if we are on the coin numbered i, we will jump to the one i places from it, always in a clockwise order, beginning with coin number 1. For an example, see the figure below. Find all values of n for which there exists an arrangement of the coins in which every coin will be visited. https://services.artofproblemsolving.com/download.php?id=YXR0YWNobWVudHMvOC9jL2E0ZDRhNDVhNDY2MDdjOTVhYTMyYzk3YzFkZjhiOWVhYTYwZDdhLnBuZw==&rn=U2NyZWVuIFNob3QgMjAyMS0xMC0wNiBhdCAxNy4xMy4xNS5wbmc=
