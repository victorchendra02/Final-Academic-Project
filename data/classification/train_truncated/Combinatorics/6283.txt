On her blackboard, Alice has written n integers strictly greater than 1. Then, she can, as often as she likes, erase two numbers a and b such that a neq b, and replace them with q and q^2, where q is the product of the prime factors of ab (each prime factor is counted only once). For instance, if Alice erases the numbers 4 and 6, the prime factors of ab = 2^3 times 3 and 2 and 3, and Alice writes q = 6 and q^2 =36. Prove that, after some time, and whatever Alice's strategy is, the list of numbers written on the blackboard will never change anymore. Note: The order of the numbers of the list is not important.
