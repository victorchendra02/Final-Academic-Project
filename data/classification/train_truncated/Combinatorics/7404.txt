We have two piles with 2000 and 2017 coins respectively. Ann and Bob take alternate turns making the following moves: The player whose turn is to move picks a pile with at least two coins, removes from that pile t coins for some 2 le t le 4, and adds to the other pile 1 coin. The players can choose a different t at each turn, and the player who cannot make a move loses. If Ann plays first determine which player has a winning strategy.
