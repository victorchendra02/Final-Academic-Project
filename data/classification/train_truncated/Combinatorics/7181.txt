1399 points and some chords between them is given. a) In every step we can take two chords RS,PQ with a common point other than P,Q,R,S and erase exactly one of RS,PQ and draw PS,PR,QS,QR let s be the minimum of chords after some steps. Find the maximum of s over all initial positions. b) In every step we can take two chords RS,PQ with a common point other than P,Q,R,S and erase both of RS,PQ and draw PS,PR,QS,QR let s be the minimum of chords after some steps.
