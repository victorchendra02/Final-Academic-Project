Let k be a positive integer. Lexi has a dictionary mathbb{D} consisting of some k-letter strings containing only the letters A and B. Lexi would like to write either the letter A or the letter B in each cell of a k times k grid so that each column contains a string from mathbb{D} when read from top-to-bottom and each row contains a string from mathbb{D} when read from left-to-right. What is the smallest integer m such that if mathbb{D} contains at least m different strings, then Lexi can fill her grid in this manner, no matter what strings are in mathbb{D}?
