Prove that there exists a four-coloring of the set M = {1, 2, cdots, 1987 } such that any arithmetic progression with 10 terms in the set M is not monochromatic. Alternative formulation Let M = {1, 2, cdots, 1987 }. Prove that there is a function f : M to {1, 2, 3, 4 } that is not constant on every set of 10 terms from M that form an arithmetic progression.
