Let S = {1,..., 999 }. Determine the smallest integer m. for which there exist m two-sided cards C_1,..., C_m with the following properties: bullet Every card C_i has an integer from S on one side and another integer from S on the other side. bullet For all x,y in S with x ne y, it is possible to select a card C_i that shows x on one of its sides and another card C_j (with i ne j) that shows y on one of its sides.
