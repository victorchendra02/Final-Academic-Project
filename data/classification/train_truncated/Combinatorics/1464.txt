Three persons A,B,C, are playing the following game: A k-element subset of the set {1, . . . , 1986 } is randomly chosen, with an equal probability of each choice, where k is a fixed positive integer less than or equal to 1986. The winner is A,B or C, respectively, if the sum of the chosen numbers leaves a remainder of 0, 1, or 2 when divided by 3. For what values of k is this game a fair one? (A game is fair if the three outcomes are equally probable.)
