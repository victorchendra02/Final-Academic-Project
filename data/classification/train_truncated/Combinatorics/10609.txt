A 2N times2N board is covered by non-overlapping dominos of 1 times2 size. A lame rook (which can only move one cell at a time, horizontally or vertically) has visited each cell once on its route across the board. Call a move by the rook longitudinal if it is a move from one cell of a domino to another cell of the same domino. What is: the maximum possible number of longitudinal moves? the minimum possible number of longitudinal moves?
