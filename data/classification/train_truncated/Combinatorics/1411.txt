Let N = {1,2 ldots, n }, n geq 2. A collection F = {A_1, ldots, A_t } of subsets A_i subseteq N, i = 1, ldots, t, is said to be separating, if for every pair {x,y } subseteq N, there is a set A_i in F so that A_i cap {x,y } contains just one element. F is said to be covering, if every element of N is contained in at least one set A_i in F. What is the smallest value f(n) of t, so there is a set F = {A_1, ldots, A_t } which is simultaneously separating and covering?
