Let a and b be distinct positive integers. The following infinite process takes place on an initially empty board. If there is at least a pair of equal numbers on the board, we choose such a pair and increase one of its components by a and the other by b. If no such pair exists, we write two times the number 0. Prove that, no matter how we make the choices in (i), operation (ii) will be performed only finitely many times. Proposed by Serbia.
