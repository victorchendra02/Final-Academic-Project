Abolf is on the second step of a stairway to heaven in every step of this stairway except the first one which is the hell there is a devil who is either a human, an elf or a demon and tempts Abolf. The devil in the second step is Satan himself as one of three forms. Whenever an elf or a demon tries to tempt Abolf he resists and walks one step up but when a human tempts Abolf he is deceived and hence he walks one step down. However if Abolf is deceived by Satan for the first time he resists and does not fall down to hell but the second time he falls down to eternal hell. Every time a devil makes a temptation it changes its form from a human, an elf, a demon to an elf, a demon, a human respectively. Prove that Abolf passes each step after some time.
