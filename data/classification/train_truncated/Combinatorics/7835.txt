Let A be a given finite set with some of its subsets called pretty. Let a subset be called small, if it's a subset of a pretty set. Let a subset be called big, if it has a pretty subset. (A set can be small and big simultaneously, and a set can be neither small nor big.) Let a denote the number of elements of A, and let p, s and b denote the number of pretty, small and big sets, respectively. Prove that 2^a cdot p le s cdot b. Proposed by Andras Imolay, Budapest
