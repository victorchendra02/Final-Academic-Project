Let n{} be a positive integer, and let mathcal{C} be a collection of subsets of {1,2, ldots,2^n } satisfying both of the following conditions: Every (2^n-1)-element subset of {1,2, ldots,2^n } is a member of mathcal{C}, and Every non-empty member C of mathcal{C} contains an element c such that C setminus {c } is again a member of mathcal{C}. Determine the smallest size mathcal{C} may have. Serbia, Pavle Martinovic
