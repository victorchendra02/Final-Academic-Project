Emperor Zorg wishes to found a colony on a new planet. Each of the n cities that he will establish there will have to speak exactly one of the Empire's 2020 official languages. Some towns in the colony will be connected by a direct air link, each link can be taken in both directions. The emperor fixed the cost of the ticket for each connection to 1 galactic credit. He wishes that, given any two cities speaking the same language, it is always possible to travel from one to the other via these air links, and that the cheapest trip between these two cities costs exactly 2020 galactic credits. For what values of n can Emperor Zorg fulfill his dream?
