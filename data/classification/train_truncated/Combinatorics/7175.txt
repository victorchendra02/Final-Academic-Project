The underline{ text{path number}} of a graph is the minimum number of paths we need to partition the vertices of a graph. Given a connected graph with the independence number k > 1, what is the maximum possible value for the path number in this graph? Find the answer in terms of k. The independence number of a graph textbf{G} is the maximum possible number k, such that there exist k pairwise non-adjacent vertices in textbf{G}.
