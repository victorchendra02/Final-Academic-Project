Prove that for any natural number m there exists a natural number n such that any n distinct points on the plane can be partitioned into m non-empty sets whose convex hulls have a common point. The convex hull of a finite set X of points on the plane is the set of points lying inside or on the boundary of at least one convex polygon with vertices in X , including degenerate ones, that is, the segment and the point are considered convex polygons. No three vertices of a convex polygon are collinear. The polygon contains its border.
