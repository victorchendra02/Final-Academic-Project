Let m be a positive integer. Consider a 4m times 4m array of square unit cells. Two different cells are related to each other if they are in either the same row or in the same column. No cell is related to itself. Some cells are colored blue, such that every cell is related to at least two blue cells. Determine the minimum number of blue cells.
