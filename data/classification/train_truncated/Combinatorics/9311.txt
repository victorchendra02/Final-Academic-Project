In a language, an alphabet with 25 letters is used; words are exactly all sequences of ( not necessarily different ) letters of length 17. Two ends of a paper strip are glued so that the strip forms a ring; the strip bears a sequence of 5^{18} letters. Say that a word is singular if one can cut a piece bearing exactly that word from the strip, but one cannot cut out two such non-overlapping pieces. It is known that one can cut out 5^{16} non-overlapping pieces each containing the same word. Determine the largest possible number of singular words. (Bogdanov I.)
