A set S= { s_1,s_2,...,s_k } of positive real numbers is "polygonal" if k geq 3 and there is a non-degenerate planar k-gon whose side lengths are exactly s_1,s_2,...,s_k; the set S is multipolygonal if in every partition of S into two subsets,each of which has at least three elements, exactly one of these two subsets in polygonal. Fix an integer n geq 7. (a) Does there exist an n-element multipolygonal set, removal of whose maximal element leaves a multipolygonal set? (b) Is it possible that every (n-1)-element subset of an n-element set of positive real numbers be multipolygonal?
