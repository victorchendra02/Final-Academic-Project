Two students A and B are playing the following game: Each of them writes down on a sheet of paper a positive integer and gives the sheet to the referee. The referee writes down on a blackboard two integers, one of which is the sum of the integers written by the players. After that, the referee asks student A: Can you tell the integer written by the other student? If A answers no, the referee puts the same question to student B. If B answers no, the referee puts the question back to A, and so on. Assume that both students are intelligent and truthful. Prove that after a finite number of questions, one of the students will answer yes.
