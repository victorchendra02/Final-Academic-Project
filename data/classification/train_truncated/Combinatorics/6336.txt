There are n people standing on a circular track. We want to perform a number of moves so that we end up with a situation where the distance between every two neighbours is the same. The move that is allowed consists in selecting two people and asking one of them to walk a distance d on the circular track clockwise, and asking the other to walk the same distance on the track anticlockwise. The two people selected and the quantity d can vary from move to move. Prove that it is possible to reach the desired situation (where the distance between every two neighbours is the same) after at most n-1 moves.
