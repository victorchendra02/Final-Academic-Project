The kingdom of Anisotropy consists of n cities. For every two cities there exists exactly one direct one-way road between them. We say that a path from X to Y is a sequence of roads such that one can move from X to Y along this sequence without returning to an already visited city. A collection of paths is called diverse if no road belongs to two or more paths in the collection. Let A and B be two distinct cities in Anisotropy. Let N_{AB} denote the maximal number of paths in a diverse collection of paths from A to B. Similarly, let N_{BA} denote the maximal number of paths in a diverse collection of paths from B to A. Prove that the equality N_{AB} = N_{BA} holds if and only if the number of roads going out from A is the same as the number of roads going out from B. Proposed by Warut Suksompong, Thailand
