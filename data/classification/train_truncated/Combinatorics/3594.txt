Let a and b be positive integers, and let A and B be finite sets of integers satisfying (i) A and B are disjoint; (ii) if an integer i belongs to either to A or to B, then either i+a belongs to A or i-b belongs to B. Prove that a left lvert A right rvert = b left lvert B right rvert. (Here left lvert X right rvert denotes the number of elements in the set X.)
