Let mathcal{P} be a convex polygon and textbf{T} be a triangle with vertices among the vertices of mathcal{P}. By removing textbf{T} from mathcal{P}, we end up with 0, 1, 2, or 3 smaller polygons (possibly with shared vertices) which we call the effect of textbf{T}. A triangulation of P is a way of dissecting it into some triangles using some non-intersecting diagonals. We call a triangulation of mathcal{P} underline{ text{beautiful}}, if for each of its triangles, the effect of this triangle contains exactly one polygon with an odd number of vertices. Prove that a triangulation of mathcal{P} is beautiful if and only if we can remove some of its diagonals and end up with all regions as quadrilaterals.
