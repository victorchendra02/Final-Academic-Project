In January Kolya and Vasya have been assessed at school 20 times and each has been given 20 marks (each being an integer no greater than 5 , with both Kolya and Vasya receiving at least twos on each occasion). Kolya has been given as many fives as Vasya fours, as many fours as Vasya threes, as many threes as Vasya twos and as many twos as Vasya fives. If each has the same average mark , determine how many twos were given to Kolya. (S . Fomin, Leningrad)
