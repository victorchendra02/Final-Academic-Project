Let a_1,a_2, ldots,a_n be a finite sequence of non negative integers, its subsequences are the sequences of the form a_i,a_{i+1}, ldots,a_j with 1 le i le j le n. Two subsequences are said to be equal if they have the same length and have the same terms, that is, two subsequences a_i,a_{i+1}, ldots,a_j and a_u,a_{u+1}, ldots a_v are equal iff j-i=u-v and a_{i+k}=a_{u+k} forall integers k such that 0 le k le j-1. Finally, we say that a subsequence a_i,a_{i+1}, ldots,a_j is palindromic if a_{i+k}=a_{j-k} forall integers k such that 0 le k le j-i What is the greatest number of different palindromic subsequences that can a palindromic sequence of length n contain?
