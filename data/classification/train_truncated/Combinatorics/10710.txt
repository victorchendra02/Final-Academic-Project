There are 25 masks of different colours. k sages play the following game. They are shown all the masks. Then the sages agree on their strategy. After that the masks are put on them so that each sage sees the masks on the others but can not see who wears each mask and does not see his own mask. No communication is allowed. Then each of them simultaneously names one colour trying to guess the colour of his mask. Find the minimum k for which the sages can agree so that at least one of them surely guesses the colour of his mask. ( S. Berlov )
