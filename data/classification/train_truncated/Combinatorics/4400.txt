In a soccer tournament each team plays exactly one game with all others. The winner gets 3 points, the loser gets 0 and each team gets 1 point in case of a draw. It is known that n teams (n geq 3) participated in the tournament and the final classification is given by the arithmetical progression of the points, the last team having only 1 point. Prove that this configuration is unattainable when n=12 Find all values of n and all configurations when this is possible
