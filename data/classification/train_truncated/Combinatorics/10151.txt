Seated in a circle are 11 wizards. A different positive integer not exceeding 1000 is pasted onto the forehead of each. A wizard can see the numbers of the other 10, but not his own. Simultaneously, each wizard puts up either his left hand or his right hand. Then each declares the number on his forehead at the same time. Is there a strategy on which the wizards can agree beforehand, which allows each of them to make the correct declaration?
