The function F is defined on the set of nonnegative integers and takes nonnegative integer values satisfying the following conditions: for every n geq 0, (i) F(4n) = F(2n) + F(n), (ii) F(4n + 2) = F(4n) + 1, (iii) F(2n + 1) = F(2n) + 1. Prove that for each positive integer m, the number of integers n with 0 leq n < 2^m and F(4n) = F(3n) is F(2^{m + 1}).
