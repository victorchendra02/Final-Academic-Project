Show that r = 2 is the largest real number r which satisfies the following condition: If a sequence a_1, a_2, ldots of positive integers fulfills the inequalities a_n leq a_{n+2} leq sqrt{a_n^2+ra_{n+1}}for every positive integer n, then there exists a positive integer M such that a_{n+2} = a_n for every n geq M.
