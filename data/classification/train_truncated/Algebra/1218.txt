Let mathbb{R} be the set of real numbers. Does there exist a function f: mathbb{R} mapsto mathbb{R} which simultaneously satisfies the following three conditions? (a) There is a positive number M such that forall x: - M leq f(x) leq M. (b) The value of f(1) is 1. (c) If x neq 0, then f left(x + frac {1}{x^2} right) = f(x) + left[ f left( frac {1}{x} right) right]^2
