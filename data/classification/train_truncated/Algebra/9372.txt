The set of polynomials f_1, f_2, ldots, f_n with real coefficients is called special , if for any different i,j,k in { 1,2, ldots, n } polynomial dfrac{2}{3}f_i + f_j + f_k has no real roots, but for any different p,q,r,s in { 1,2, ldots, n } of a polynomial f_p + f_q + f_r + f_s there is a real root. a) Give an example of a special set of four polynomials whose sum is not a zero polynomial. b) Is there a special set of five polynomials?
