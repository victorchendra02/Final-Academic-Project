The real numbers alpha_1 , alpha_2, alpha_3, ldots, alpha_n are positive. Let us denote by h = frac{n}{1/ alpha_1 + 1/ alpha_2 + cdots + 1/ alpha_n} the harmonic mean, g= sqrt[n]{ alpha_1 alpha_2 cdots alpha_n} the geometric mean, and a= frac{ alpha_1+ alpha_2+ cdots + alpha_n}{n} the arithmetic mean. Prove that h leq g leq a, and that each of the equalities implies the other one.
