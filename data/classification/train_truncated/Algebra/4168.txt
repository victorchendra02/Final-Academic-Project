Let f, g be functions from the positive integers to the integers. Vlad the impala is jumping around the integer grid. His initial position is x_0 = (0, 0), and for every n ge 1, his jump is x_n - x_{n - 1} = ( pm f(n), pm g(n)) or ( pm g(n), pm f(n)), with eight possibilities in total. Is it always possible that Vlad can choose his jumps to return to his initial location (0, 0) infinitely many times when (a) f, g are polynomials with integer coefficients? (b) f, g are any pair of functions from the positive integers to the integers?
