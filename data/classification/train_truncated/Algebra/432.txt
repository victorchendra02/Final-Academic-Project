For a positive integer n we denote by s(n) the sum of the digits of n. Let P(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ cdots+a_1x+a_0 be a polynomial, where n geqslant 2 and a_i is a positive integer for all 0 leqslant i leqslant n-1. Could it be the case that, for all positive integers k, s(k) and s(P(k)) have the same parity?
