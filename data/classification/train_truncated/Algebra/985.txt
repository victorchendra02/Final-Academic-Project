Let {a_1,a_2, dots,a_n} be positive real numbers, {n>1}. Denote by g_n their geometric mean, and by A_1,A_2, dots,A_n the sequence of arithmetic means defined by A_k= frac{a_1+a_2+ cdots+a_k}{k}, qquad k=1,2, dots,n. Let G_n be the geometric mean of A_1,A_2, dots,A_n. Prove the inequality n root n of{ frac{G_n}{A_n}}+ frac{g_n}{G_n} le n+1 and establish the cases of equality. Proposed by Finbarr Holland, Ireland
