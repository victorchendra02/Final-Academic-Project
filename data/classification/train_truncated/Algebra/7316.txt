Let n be a positive integer. A finite set of integers is called n-divided if there are exactly n ways to partition this set into two subsets with equal sums. For example, the set {1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 } is 2-divided because the only ways to partition it into two subsets with equal sums is by dividing it into {1, 3, 4, 5 } and {6, 7 }, or {1, 5, 7 } and {3, 4, 6 }. Find all the integers n > 0 for which there exists a n-divided set. Proposed by Martin Rakovsky, France
