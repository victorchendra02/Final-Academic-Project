For 2k real numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_k, b_1, b_2, ..., b_k define a sequence of numbers X_n by X_n = sum_{i=1}^k [a_in + b_i] quad (n=1,2,...). If the sequence X_N forms an arithmetic progression, show that textstyle sum_{i=1}^k a_i must be an integer. Here [r] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to r.
