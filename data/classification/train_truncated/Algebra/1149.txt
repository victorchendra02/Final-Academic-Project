For any two nonnegative integers n and k satisfying n geq k, we define the number c(n,k) as follows: - c left(n,0 right)=c left(n,n right)=1 for all n geq 0; - c left(n+1,k right)=2^{k}c left(n,k right)+c left(n,k-1 right) for n geq k geq 1. Prove that c left(n,k right)=c left(n,n-k right) for all n geq k geq 0.
