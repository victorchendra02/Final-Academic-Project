a) We have a geometric sequence of 3 terms. If the sum of these terms is 26 , and their sum of squares is 364 , find the terms of the sequence. b) Suppose that a,b,c,u,v,w are positive real numbers , and each of a,b,c and u,v,w are geometric sequences. Suppose also that a+u,b+v,c+w are an arithmetic sequence. Prove that a=b=c and u=v=w c) Let a,b,c,d be real numbers (not all zero), and let f(x,y,z) be the polynomial in three variables defined byf(x,y,z) = axyz + b(xy + yz + zx) + c(x+y+z) + d.Prove that f(x,y,z) is reducible if and only if a,b,c,d is a geometric sequence.
