"Let n geq 2 be an integer. Alice and Bob play a game concerning a country made of n islands. Exactly two of those n islands have a factory. Initially there is no bridge in the country. Alice and Bob take turns in the following way. In each turn, the player must build a bridge between two different islands I_1 and I_2 such that: bullet I_1 and I_2 are not already connected by a bridge. bullet at least one of the two islands I_1 and I_2 is connected by a series of bridges to an island with a factory (or has a factory itself). (Indeed, access to a factory is needed for the construction.) As soon as a player builds a bridge that makes it possible to go from one factory to the other, this player loses the game.
