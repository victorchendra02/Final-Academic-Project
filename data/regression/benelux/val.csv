Let n be a positive integer. Suppose that its positive divisors can be partitioned into pairs (i.e. can be split in groups of two) in such a way that the sum of each pair is a prime number. Prove that these prime numbers are distinct and that none of these are a divisor of n.,5.194805194805195,Medium
"Given trapezoid ABCD with parallel sides AB and CD, let E be a point on line BC outside segment BC, such that segment AE intersects segment CD. Assume that there exists a point F inside segment AD such that angle EAD= angle CBF. Denote by I the point of intersection of CD and EF, and by J the point of intersection of AB and EF. Let K be the midpoint of segment EF, and assume that K is different from I and J. Prove that K belongs to the circumcircle of triangle ABI if and only if K belongs to the circumcircle of triangle CDJ.",8.571428571428573,Very Hard
"Let k ge 1 be a positive integer. We consider 4k chips, 2k of which are red and 2k of which are blue. A sequence of those 4k chips can be transformed into another sequence by a so-called move, consisting of interchanging a number (possibly one) of consecutive red chips with an equal number of consecutive blue chips. For example, we can move from r underline{bb}br underline{rr}b to r underline{rr}br underline{bb}b where r denotes a red chip and b denotes a blue chip. Determine the smallest number n (as a function of k) such that starting from any initial sequence of the 4k chips, we need at most n moves to reach the state in which the first 2k chips are red.",5.333333333333333,Medium
