"Let ABC be an acute triangle with angle BAC=30^{ circ}. The internal and external angle bisectors of angle ABC meet the line AC at B_1 and B_2, respectively, and the internal and external angle bisectors of angle ACB meet the line AB at C_1 and C_2, respectively. Suppose that the circles with diameters B_1B_2 and C_1C_2 meet inside the triangle ABC at point P. Prove that angle BPC=90^{ circ} .",5.271428571428571,Medium

"The country Dreamland consists of 2016 cities. The airline Starways wants to establish some one-way flights between pairs of cities in such a way that each city has exactly one flight out of it. Find the smallest positive integer k such that no matter how Starways establishes its flights, the cities can always be partitioned into k groups so that from any city it is not possible to reach another city in the same group by using at most 28 flights.
