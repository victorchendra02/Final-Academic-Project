"We are given a positive integer s ge 2. For each positive integer k, we define its twist k as follows: write k as as+b, where a, b are non-negative integers and b < s, then k = bs+a. For the positive integer n, consider the infinite sequence d_1, d_2, dots where d_1=n and d_{i+1} is the twist of d_i for each positive integer i. Prove that this sequence contains 1 if and only if the remainder when n is divided by s^2-1 is either 1 or s.",5.767940979208586,Medium
