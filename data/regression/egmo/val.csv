Consider the triangle ABC with angle BCA > 90^{ circ}. The circumcircle Gamma of ABC has radius R. There is a point P in the interior of the line segment AB such that PB = PC and the length of PA is R. The perpendicular bisector of PB intersects Gamma at the points D and E. Prove P is the incentre of triangle CDE.,5.105042016806722,Medium
The numbers p and q are prime and satisfy frac{p}{{p + 1}} + frac{{q + 1}}{q} = frac{{2n}}{{n + 2}} for some positive integer n. Find all possible values of q-p. Luxembourg (Pierre Haas),5.020408163265307,Medium
Let ABC be a triangle with incentre I. The circle through B tangent to AI at I meets side AB again at P. The circle through C tangent to AI at I meets side AC again at Q. Prove that PQ is tangent to the incircle of ABC.,2.405247813411079,Easy
"Let ABC be a triangle with CA=CB and angle{ACB}=120^ circ, and let M be the midpoint of AB. Let P be a variable point of the circumcircle of ABC, and let Q be the point on the segment CP such that QP = 2QC. It is given that the line through P and perpendicular to AB intersects the line MQ at a unique point N. Prove that there exists a fixed circle such that N lies on this circle for all possible positions of P.",1.7802197802197806,Easy
"Find the smallest positive integer k for which there exists a colouring of the positive integers mathbb{Z}_{>0} with k colours and a function f: mathbb{Z}_{>0} to mathbb{Z}_{>0} with the following two properties: (i) For all positive integers m,n of the same colour, f(m+n)=f(m)+f(n). (ii) There are positive integers m,n such that f(m+n) ne f(m)+f(n). In a colouring of mathbb{Z}_{>0} with k colours, every integer is coloured in exactly one of the k colours. In both (i) and (ii) the positive integers m,n are not necessarily distinct.",7.865646258503402,Hard
"Let m > 1 be an integer. A sequence a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots is defined by a_1 = a_2 = 1, a_3 = 4, and for all n ge 4, a_n = m(a_{n - 1} + a_{n - 2}) - a_{n - 3}. Determine all integers m such that every term of the sequence is a square.",9.733893557422968,Very Hard
