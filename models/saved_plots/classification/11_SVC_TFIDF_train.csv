A windmill is a process that starts with a line ell going through a single point P in mathcal S. The line rotates clockwise about the pivot P until the first time that the line meets some other point belonging to mathcal S. This point, Q, takes over as the new pivot, and the line now rotates clockwise about Q, until it next meets a point of mathcal S. This process continues indefinitely. Show that we can choose a point P in mathcal S and a line ell going through P such that the resulting windmill uses each point of mathcal S as a pivot infinitely many times.
